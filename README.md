## Content

- [hbp_knowledge](https://github.com/pharmacome/knowledge/tree/master/hbp_knowledge): This folder contains curated BEL documents. Most have been organized by category (protein of interest, biological process of interest, pathway, etc.). AMost BEL documents correspond to a single publication, but a select few contain content from several due to topic-based curation.
- [docs](https://github.com/pharmacome/knowledge/tree/master/docs): This folder contains automatically generated HTML summaries of the content that can best be accesed through https://pharmacome.github.io/knowledge.
- [notebooks](https://github.com/pharmacome/knowledge/tree/master/notebooks): This folder contains various Jupyter notebooks associated with the repository. Since many of them use PyBEL-Jupyter, they may be best viewed using [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pharmacome/knowledge/tree/master/notebooks/).
