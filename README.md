## Content

- [hbp_knowledge](https://github.com/pharmacome/conib/tree/master/hbp_knowledge): This folder contains curated BEL
  documents. Most have been organized by category (protein of interest, biological process of interest, pathway, etc.).
  Almost BEL documents correspond to a single publication, but a select few contain content from several due to
  topic-based curation.
- [docs](https://github.com/pharmacome/conib/tree/master/docs): This folder contains automatically generated HTML
  summaries of the content that can best be accesed through https://pharmacome.github.io/conib.
- [notebooks](https://github.com/pharmacome/conib/tree/master/notebooks): This folder contains various Jupyter
  notebooks associated with the repository. Since many of them use PyBEL-Jupyter, they may be best viewed using
  [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pharmacome/conib/tree/master/notebooks/).

### Curation Planning

Here are a few links for navigating the GitHub issues and pull requests:

- [Pull requests for curation](https://github.com/pharmacome/conib/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3ACuration)
- [Pull requests for recuration approved by a reviewer](https://github.com/pharmacome/conib/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved+label%3ARecuration)

## Installation

``hbp_knowledge`` can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hbp-knowledge/) with the following command:

```bash
$ pip install hbp_knowledge
```

or the latest version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmacome/conib) with:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/pharmacome/conib.git
```

## Usage

The graph can be loaded with:

```python
import hbp_knowledge

# Get a dictionary of names to graphs
graphs = hbp_knowledge.get_graphs()

# Get all BEL documents as a single graph
graph = hbp_knowledge.get_graph()

# Get all knowledge as INDRA statements
stmts = hbp_knowledge.get_indra_statements()
```
