set of C. elegans strains, we expressed the pathological
FDTP-17 mutant DK280, which enhances aggregation,
whereas the other set harbours, in addition to DK280, the
proline substitutions I277P and I308P (PP), which act as

SET Evidence = " Resistance to aldicarb can arise from either
a pre- or a post-synaptic perturbation, whereas resistance to
levamisole typically indicates a post-synaptic defect (50).
Animals of the pro-aggregant strain displayed a mild resist-
ance to aldicarb, producing a paralysis proﬁle intermediate
between the sensitive wild-type N2 and the resistant
rab-3(js49) strain, which we used as controls (Fig. 5A)."

altered Tau solubility, shifting the equilibrium towards more

in the pro-aggregant strain (Fig. 8A, quantitation in 8B), con-
sistent with its anti-aggregation properties (31)."

applied, in the 96-well liquid culture format, the two most
promising hit compounds obtained in a mammalian cell
model of Tau toxicity (57), namely the phenylthiazolyl-

prominent Tau aggregation inhibitor compound from a recent-
ly published in vitro screen (compound #16 in reference 33),
which belongs to the ATPZ class of Tau inhibitors
(5-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-cyclopropyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihyd-
rothieno[3,4- D ]pyridazine-1-carboxamide, referred to as
cmp16 for simplicity, structure shown in Fig. 9A). This com-
pound prevents Tau ﬁbril formation in vitro, and is able to
cross the mammalian blood–brain barrier, an attribute that
makes it favourable for clinical applications (33)."

locomotion of treated animals. These animals moved
approximately 1.6 times faster than DMSO-treated controls
(Fig. 9A). "

SET Evidence = " Treatment with cmp16 diminished the
progressive accumulation of neurite gaps in the motor
neurons of the pro-aggregant animals compared with the
DMSO-treated controls (from 3.2 + 1 gaps at day 5 of the
DMSO-treated strains to 2.4 + 1 gaps of the cmp16-treated
strains, P , 0.05) (Fig. 9B). Lower accumulation of structural
damage in neurons can be interpreted as a sign of reduced neu-
rodegeneration (22,58)."
