Of these 19 genes, the first 16 listed (84%) were regulated by Protandim in the opposing direction to that taken by the atherosclerosis disease process. The probable benefit of this effect of Protandim is further supported by the fact that of the 11 gene products currently being targeted by drug interventions (Table 1, in bold type), nine of them (Table 1, marked by asterisks) are modulated by Protandim in the same direction that is proposed to be beneficial and caused by the therapeutic intervention.",
