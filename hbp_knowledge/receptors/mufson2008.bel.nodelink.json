The biological consequences of proNGF are controversial, as is the function of its accumulation in the cortex during the prodromal stages of AD. Emerging literature suggests that recombinant proNGF binds TrkA and promotes neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth similar to mature NGF, but is approximately fivefold less active than the mature NGF peptide [62,63].",

This family of receptors is acquiring increasing importance owing to its potential involvement in AD [68]. A recent study provided genetic information for a role of the proneurotrophin receptor complex comprising sortilin and p75NTR, in the mediation of neuronal viability in vivo [69]. Sortilin expression is required for p75NTR-mediated apoptosis following proNGF treatment [57], suggesting that sortilin is a p75NTR binding partner associated with the initiation of cell death [51,58]",

Increased alpha7 nAChR expression in CBF neurons may signal a compensatory response to maintain basocortical cholinergic activity during the onset of AD. Upregulation of the alpha7 nAChR within individual CBF neurons is also consistent with reports of increased alpha7 nAChR mRNA and protein expression levels in hippocampal neurons, astrocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes in AD [120–122]. The observed increase in alpha7 nAChR in early AD may regulate basocortical cholinergic tone through pre- and/or postsynaptic mechanisms within cholinergic NB neurons prior to their frank degeneration in the later stages of AD.",

The adult human brain contains six tau isoforms ranging from 48 to 67 kDa, which are expressed through alternative splicing of a single tau gene on chromosome 17 [141,142]. Three of these tau isoforms contain three tandem repeats in the carboxy-terminus end of the molecule (3Rtau), while three isoforms display four tandem repeats (4Rtau) in this region.

A similar shift did not occur during normal aging. These data suggest a subtle, yet pervasive shift in the gene dosage of 3Rtau and 4Rtau within vulnerable CBF neurons in MCI and AD [6]. Shifts in the ratio of tau transcripts may be a fundamental mechanism whereby normal tau function is dysregulated, not only in CBF neurons, but may be a more widespread process contributing to the selective vulnerability of neurons to NFT formation (Figure 1B) [143–145].

Increased alpha7 nAChR expression in CBF neurons may signal a compensatory response to maintain basocortical cholinergic activity during the onset of AD. Upregulation of the alpha7 nAChR within individual CBF neurons is also consistent with reports of increased alpha7 nAChR mRNA and protein expression levels in hippocampal neurons, astrocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes in AD [120–122]. The observed increase in alpha7 nAChR in early AD may regulate basocortical cholinergic tone through pre- and/or postsynaptic mechanisms within cholinergic NB neurons prior to their frank degeneration in the later stages of AD.",

      "evidence": " For example, the neuropeptide GAL, which functions via the interaction with three G protein-coupled receptors termed GALR1, GALR2 and GALR3, has multiple biological actions, including effects on cognition and neuroplasticity [15,146,147]. In the late [148–150] but not early [151] stage of AD, fibers within the basal forebrain containing the neuropeptide GAL thicken and hyperinnervate surviving CBF neurons. Although animal and cell-culture studies have shown that GAL plays a crucial role in the regulation of CBF neuron activity [152] and rescues cholinergic cells from amyloid toxicity [153], the molecular consequences of this unique plasticity response upon CBF neurons in AD remain unclear. Gene expression studies of cholinergic transcripts have shown that GAL hyperinnervated, but not nonhyperinnervated, CBF neurons display an upregulation of ChAT expression in AD compared to controls [126]",

BChE is localized to neurons and glia, and is associated with NFTs and senile plaques (SPs) in AD brain [32]. Interestingly, population-based genetic studies of AD have identified a point mutation that changes Ala539 to threonine in the K variant of BChE, which effectively reduces serum BChE concentrations, and may be associated with cognitive decline [33]. BChE activity also increases in AD brain whereas AChE activity remains unchanged or declines [34,35].",

ProNGF levels are increased in the cortex of subjects diagnosed with MCI or mild AD compared to those with NCI [61]. The biological consequences of proNGF are controversial, as is the function of its accumulation in the cortex during the prodromal stages of AD. Emerging literature suggests that recombinant proNGF binds TrkA and promotes neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth similar to mature NGF, but is approximately fivefold less active than the mature NGF peptide [62,63].",

A similar shift did not occur during normal aging. These data suggest a subtle, yet pervasive shift in the gene dosage of 3Rtau and 4Rtau within vulnerable CBF neurons in MCI and AD [6]. Shifts in the ratio of tau transcripts may be a fundamental mechanism whereby normal tau function is dysregulated, not only in CBF neurons, but may be a more widespread process contributing to the selective vulnerability of neurons to NFT formation (Figure 1B) [143–145].

BChE is localized to neurons and glia, and is associated with NFTs and senile plaques (SPs) in AD brain [32]. Interestingly, population-based genetic studies of AD have identified a point mutation that changes Ala539 to threonine in the K variant of BChE, which effectively reduces serum BChE concentrations, and may be associated with cognitive decline [33]. BChE activity also increases in AD brain whereas AChE activity remains unchanged or declines [34,35].",

Hippocampal ChAT activity was increased selectively in MCI cases with high Braak scores (Braak III/IV stage) indicative of advanced disease [19], suggesting that a compensatory upregulation of ChAT may be due, at least in part, to the disconnection of glutamatergic entorhinal cortex input to the hippocampus which occurs early in the disease process [21–23]. In this scenario, upregulation of hippocampal ChAT activity may be due to reactive synaptogenesis, the filling in of denervated glutamatergic synapses by cholinergic input arising from the septum [24].",

The goal of this NGF trial was to protect CBF neurons from degeneration, as well as augment the function of remaining cholinergic neurons by delivery of human NGF. After obtaining informed consent, skin biopsies were attained to generate primary cultures of autologous fibroblasts that were transfected to produce human NGF [184]. If fibroblasts were found to be acceptable based on NGF production rates, then grafts were stereotaxically placed into multiple locations within the region of the CBF neurons. Following a period of 22 months, no long-term post-surgical adverse effects were found and the rate of cognitive decline appeared to be reduced [113]. ",

ProNGF levels are increased in the cortex of subjects diagnosed with MCI or mild AD compared to those with NCI [61]. The biological consequences of proNGF are controversial, as is the function of its accumulation in the cortex during the prodromal stages of AD. Emerging literature suggests that recombinant proNGF binds TrkA and promotes neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth similar to mature NGF, but is approximately fivefold less active than the mature NGF peptide [62,63].",

The biological consequences of proNGF are controversial, as is the function of its accumulation in the cortex during the prodromal stages of AD. Emerging literature suggests that recombinant proNGF binds TrkA and promotes neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth similar to mature NGF, but is approximately fivefold less active than the mature NGF peptide [62,63].",

      "evidence": " For example, the neuropeptide GAL, which functions via the interaction with three G protein-coupled receptors termed GALR1, GALR2 and GALR3, has multiple biological actions, including effects on cognition and neuroplasticity [15,146,147]. In the late [148–150] but not early [151] stage of AD, fibers within the basal forebrain containing the neuropeptide GAL thicken and hyperinnervate surviving CBF neurons. Although animal and cell-culture studies have shown that GAL plays a crucial role in the regulation of CBF neuron activity [152] and rescues cholinergic cells from amyloid toxicity [153], the molecular consequences of this unique plasticity response upon CBF neurons in AD remain unclear. Gene expression studies of cholinergic transcripts have shown that GAL hyperinnervated, but not nonhyperinnervated, CBF neurons display an upregulation of ChAT expression in AD compared to controls [126]",

      "evidence": "The ex vivo Phase I trial attempted to move beyond currently available treatments for AD [113]. The goal of this NGF trial was to protect CBF neurons from degeneration, as well as augment the function of remaining cholinergic neurons by delivery of human NGF. After obtaining informed consent, skin biopsies were attained to generate primary cultures of autologous fibroblasts that were transfected to produce human NGF [184]. If fibroblasts were found to be acceptable based on NGF production rates, then grafts were stereotaxically placed into multiple locations within the region of the CBF neurons. Following a period of 22 months, no long-term post-surgical adverse effects were found and the rate of cognitive decline appeared to be reduced [113]. ",
