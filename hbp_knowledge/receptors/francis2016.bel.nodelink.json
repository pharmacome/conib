      "evidence": "Pyramidal neurons, which account for ~70% of all neurons in the neocortex, use glutamate as their primary neurotransmitter. Nonetheless, in addition to possessing glutamatergic receptors on their surface, these neurons often also possess cholinergic receptors, which are capable of receiving cholinergic inputs into the neocortex from the basal forebrain. The presence of these cholinergic receptors has been putatively linked to an important finding regarding the interaction between the cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission systems. In particular, rodent studies have revealed that cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) promote the release of glutamate from pyramidal neurons,16 with the proposed explanation being that ChEI administration leads to increased cortical ACh concentrations and, consequently, increased binding of ACh by cholinergic receptors on pyramidal neurons, thereby stimulating neuronal firing (ie, glutamate release).",
