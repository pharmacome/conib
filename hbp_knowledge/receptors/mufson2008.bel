SET Evidence="In
MCI, increased hippocampal and frontal cortex ChAT tone
may be important for promoting biochemical activity or compensating
for neurodegenerative defects, which may delay the
transition of these subjects to frank AD. Hippocampal ChAT
activity was increased selectively in MCI cases with high Braak
scores (Braak III/IV stage) indicative of advanced disease [19],
suggesting that a compensatory upregulation of ChAT may
be due, at least in part, to the disconnection of glutamatergic
entorhinal cortex input to the hippocampus which occurs early
in the disease process [21–23]. In this scenario, upregulation of
hippocampal ChAT activity may be due to reactive synaptogenesis,
the filling in of denervated glutamatergic synapses by
cholinergic input arising from the septum [24]."

AChE that is widely distributed throughout the CNS and also
catalyzes the hydrolysis of ACh. BChE is localized to neurons and
glia, and is associated with NFTs and senile plaques (SPs) in AD
brain [32]. Interestingly, population-based genetic studies of AD
have identified a point mutation that changes Ala539 to threonine
in the K variant of BChE, which effectively reduces serum BChE
concentrations, and may be associated with cognitive decline [33].

of the survival and growth effects of NGF [50], and to the p75NTR
receptor, which is a positive modulator of NGF/TrkA binding [50].
However, p75NTR has multiple functions, including apoptotic or cell
death actions [51–56], which are dependent upon its interaction with
various receptor chaperones [57–59]."

of proNGF are controversial, as is the function of its accumulation
in the cortex during the prodromal stages of AD. Emerging
literature suggests that recombinant proNGF binds TrkA and promotes
neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth similar to mature
NGF, but is approximately fivefold less active than the mature

with p75NTR to mediate proNGF-induced cell death. This
family of receptors is acquiring increasing importance owing to
its potential involvement in AD [68]. A recent study provided
genetic information for a role of the proneurotrophin receptor
complex comprising sortilin and p75NTR, in the mediation of
neuronal viability in vivo [69]. Sortilin expression is required for
p75NTR-mediated apoptosis following proNGF treatment [57],

lack of regulation of p75NTR expression [7] in CBF neurons. A
‘step down’ dysregulation of trk expression may, in part, underlie
CBF neuron demise associated with the clinical presentation of
