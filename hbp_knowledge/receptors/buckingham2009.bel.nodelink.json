In this context, it is of interest that FYN has also been shown to activate the PI3K/AKT cascade, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (Tang et al., 2007). Indeed, FYN is required for phos- phorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE), which itself regulates AKT (Fig. 3). PIKE binds to AKT and up-regulates its kinase a ctivity, thereby reducing apoptosis. Phosphorylation protects PIKE from caspase cleavage, hence FYN is antiapoptotic (Tang et al., 2007).",

Abeta, however, activates a mutant (L250T) of the alpha7 receptor—this mutant conducts current in the desensitized state, indicating that Abeta may exert its antagonistic action through receptor desensitization (Grassi et al., 2003).",

JAK-2 is also activated by nicotine in non-neuronal cells such as nAChR-bearing keratinocytes (Arredondo et al., 2006). In a microarray study, expression of 8 of 33 JAK/STAT pathway genes was altered when human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to 5 microM nicotine for 4 to 10 h (Tsai et al., 2006). Thus, the JAK-2/STAT-3 pathway is activated by exposure to nicotine.",

      "evidence": "There is evidence that ApoE directly interacts with nAChRs. An APOE-derived peptide blocks nAChRs on rat hippocampal slices with a submicromolar affinity, and this action is dependent on an arginine-rich segment of the APOE peptide (Klein and Yakel, 2004). Block of heterologously expressed alpha7 nAChRs is greater than that for alpha4beta2 or alpha2beta2 nAChRs (Gay et al., 2006). This block of alpha7 receptors is abolished when alpha7 Trp55 is mutated to alanine, providing strong evidence that it results from a direct interaction between the peptide and the receptors (Gay et al., 2007), and the effects of other substitutions of Trp55 suggests that this interaction is hydrophobic",

      "evidence": "Nicotine stimulates the secretion of betaAPP, which is trophic and neuroprotective against Abeta, from PC12 cells through an alpha7 and calcium-dependent pathway (Kim et al., 1997) as well as increasing the secretion of soluble APP and lowering the Abeta-containing sAPP-gamma in rats (Lahiri et al., 2002), again through nAChR-dependent mechanisms. Galantamine, a nAChR potentiator and AChE inhibitor, also increases the secretion of sAPP from human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Lenzken et al., 2007) through the activation of nAChRs. It therefore seems that activation of nAChRs shifts the balance of APP processing away from beta-amyloidogenic to soluble APP production.",

Indeed, Abeta activates both FYN and the PI3K cascade (Williamson et al., 2002), whereas germline knockout of FYN is neuroprotective in mice (Lambert et al., 1998; Chin et al., 2004). FYN knockout protects mature mouse neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures (Lambert et al., 1998).",

This phosphorylation is concomitant with phosphorylation and inactivation of focal adhesion kinase 1 (FADK1, a major downstream target of FYN), is blocked by inhibitors of SRC kinases and PI3K, and involves FYN associating physically with FADK1 (Williamson et al., 2002).",

Given that alpha7 homomeric nAChRs are much more permeable to calcium ions than are most other nAChRs (Bertrand et al., 1993), it is to be expected that nicotinic neuroprotection mediated by nAChRs, notably alpha7, would depend upon the activation of calcium signaling pathways. ABT-418 is a nicotinic agonist that protects primary rat cortical neurons from glutamate toxicity through its activation of alpha7 nAChRs, and this is blocked when calcium is removed from the extracellular medium (Donnelly-Roberts et al., 1996).",

It is therefore possible that the toxicity of Abeta is mediated, at least in part, through a direct physical interaction between Abeta and nAChRs.",

Abeta, however, activates a mutant (L250T) of the alpha7 receptor—this mutant conducts current in the desensitized state, indicating that Abeta may exert its antagonistic action through receptor desensitization (Grassi et al., 2003).",

In addition, mice transgenically overexpressing Abeta or with mutations that enhance Abeta aggregation show many of the symptoms of AD (Hsiao et al., 1996; van Groen et al., 2006).",

Donepezil protects cultured rat cortical neurons against Abeta toxicity through both alpha7 and non-alpha7 nAChRs (Takada et al., 2003). It is therefore likely that alpha7 nAChRs are the primary mediators of nicotine neuroprotection, but in some cells, non-alpha7 subtypes are also likely to contribute.",

In the cortex and hippocampus of mice, nicotine’s inhibition of MAPK (shown by RNAi reduction of alpha7 expression to be alpha7-dependent) prevents activation of nuclear factor- kappaB and c-Myc, also thereby reducing the activity of inducible nitric-oxide synthetase and NO production and decreasing Abeta production (Liu et al., 2007).",

Galantamine, a nAChR potentiator and AChE inhibitor, also increases the secretion of sAPP from human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Lenzken et al., 2007) through the activation of nAChRs. It therefore seems that activation of nAChRs shifts the balance of APP processing away from beta-amyloidogenic to soluble APP production.",

JAK-2 is also activated by nicotine in non-neuronal cells such as nAChR-bearing keratinocytes (Arredondo et al., 2006). In a microarray study, expression of 8 of 33 JAK/STAT pathway genes was altered when human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to 5 microM nicotine for 4 to 10 h (Tsai et al., 2006). Thus, the JAK-2/STAT-3 pathway is activated by exposure to nicotine.",

Given that alpha7 homomeric nAChRs are much more permeable to calcium ions than are most other nAChRs (Bertrand et al., 1993), it is to be expected that nicotinic neuroprotection mediated by nAChRs, notably alpha7, would depend upon the activation of calcium signaling pathways. ABT-418 is a nicotinic agonist that protects primary rat cortical neurons from glutamate toxicity through its activation of alpha7 nAChRs, and this is blocked when calcium is removed from the extracellular medium (Donnelly-Roberts et al., 1996).",

In this context, it is of interest that FYN has also been shown to activate the PI3K/AKT cascade, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (Tang et al., 2007). Indeed, FYN is required for phos- phorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE), which itself regulates AKT (Fig. 3). PIKE binds to AKT and up-regulates its kinase a ctivity, thereby reducing apoptosis. Phosphorylation protects PIKE from caspase cleavage, hence FYN is antiapoptotic (Tang et al., 2007).",

Indeed, FYN is required for phos- phorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE), which itself regulates AKT (Fig. 3). PIKE binds to AKT and up-regulates its kinase a ctivity, thereby reducing apoptosis. Phosphorylation protects PIKE from caspase cleavage, hence FYN is antiapoptotic (Tang et al., 2007).",

Given that alpha7 homomeric nAChRs are much more permeable to calcium ions than are most other nAChRs (Bertrand et al., 1993), it is to be expected that nicotinic neuroprotection mediated by nAChRs, notably alpha7, would depend upon the activation of calcium signaling pathways. ABT-418 is a nicotinic agonist that protects primary rat cortical neurons from glutamate toxicity through its activation of alpha7 nAChRs, and this is blocked when calcium is removed from the extracellular medium (Donnelly-Roberts et al., 1996).",

      "evidence": "Calcium signaling pathways are involved both in the toxic action of Abeta and in the protection against that toxicity offered by nicotinic ligands. Given that alpha7 homomeric nAChRs are much more permeable to calcium ions than are most other nAChRs (Bertrand et al., 1993), it is to be expected that nicotinic neuroprotection mediated by nAChRs, notably alpha7, would depend upon the activation of calcium signaling pathways. ABT-418 is a nicotinic agonist that protects primary rat cortical neurons from glutamate toxicity through its activation of alpha7 nAChRs, and this is blocked when calcium is removed from the extracellular medium (Donnelly-Roberts et al., 1996).",

However, the sustained calcium rise seen in these cells upon prolonged nicotine administration, which is more likely to be of relevance to neuroprotection than short-term responses, is more dependent upon the activation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (Dajas-Bailador et al., 2002a), which are also a target for phosphorylation by FYN (Cui et al., 2004).",

Galantamine, a nAChR potentiator and AChE inhibitor, also increases the secretion of sAPP from human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Lenzken et al., 2007) through the activation of nAChRs. It therefore seems that activation of nAChRs shifts the balance of APP processing away from beta-amyloidogenic to soluble APP production.",
