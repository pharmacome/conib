SET Evidence ="As anticipated, TDF interacted covalently with E. electricus electroplaque as an irreversible competitive antagonist, and curare protected against this cova- lent attachment"
# TDF = p-trim- ethylammonium benzenediazonium fluoroborate (TDF). Skipping the fluoroborate part for now.
SET Confidence = "High"

a(MESH:Curare) -| act(a(CHEBI:"4-(trimethylammonium)benzenediazonium"))
UNSET Confidence

SET Evidence ="The method was subsequently improved upon with the synthesis of 4-(N-maleimido)phenyltrimethyl- ammonium iodide, whereby the diazonium is substituted with a maleimide group"
# the method = affinity labeling
SET Confidence = "High"
a(CHEBI:"4-(N-Maleimido)phenyltrimethylammonium iodide") -> act(a(MESH:"Affinity Labels"))
UNSET Confidence

SET Evidence ="It was now possible to follow reversible binding to these purified membranes using the nicotinic agonist decamethonium as the radioactive ligand (by the method of equilibrium dialysis that Gilbert and Müller-Hill (9) used to identify the lac repressor)"
SET Confidence = "High"
a(CHEBI:decamethonium) -| act(a(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))
UNSET Confidence

SET Evidence ="The detergent deoxycholate gently extracted the binding protein without denaturing it, and bound decamethonium was displaced by var- ious nicotinic agonists and antagonists, including curare and Flaxedil in the order of their physiological effects"
SET Confidence = "Medium"
a(MESH:"Gallamine Triethiodide") -| act(a(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))
a(MESH:Curare) -> act(a(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))
#above Statement was added
UNSET Confidence

SET Evidence ="Third, Chen-Yuan Lee, a Taiwanese pharmacologist, had found that a snake venom toxin, alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT), spe- cifically blocks in vivo neuromuscular transmission in high ver- tebrates at the postsynaptic level without interacting with AChE"
SET Confidence = "High"
a(MESH:Bungarotoxins) -| bp(GO:"neuromuscular synaptic transmission")
UNSET Confidence

SET Evidence ="alpha-BGT blocked the electroplaque’s electrical response in vivo and the microsac’s ion flux response to nicotinic agonists in vitro; alpha-BGT also blocked the binding of radioactive decamethonium to the detergent extract"
SET Confidence = "Low"
a(MESH:Bungarotoxins)  -| act(a(MESH:"Electric Organ"))
a(MESH:Bungarotoxins) -| act(a(CHEBI:decamethonium))
# the above line seems little ambiguous. Doesn't it say that Bungarotoxins block binding of decamethonium to detergent extract but not the decamethonium directly?
## yes, it should be coded as a blocking of the complex of decamethonium and detergent extract
UNSET Confidence

SET Evidence ="Confirmation of the binding site organization has come from the crystal structure of a soluble snail protein that binds ACh, the ACh-binding protein, a close homolog of the nAChR extra- cellular domain (60) and of the full-length eukaryotic GluCl receptor (61) and the prokaryotic Erwinia chrysanthemi recep- tor (ELIC) bound with GABA (62) and ACh (as an antagonist)"

#not sure how to bring this to the triple.
## i'm not sure either but I think it's not necessary to include it

#the topic in the paper as well as evidence talks about ion channels and there is no mention of ACHE

SET Evidence ="A second important group consists of modulators, such as galantamine, that bind at “non-agonist” interfaces, which, in heteropentameric nAChRs, differ from the neurotransmitter- binding site and appear to be homologs of the benzodiazepine site on GABAA receptors"
