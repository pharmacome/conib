They are classically defined as being activated by muscarine, a toxin from the mushroom Amanita muscaria, and inhibited by atropine, a toxin from Atropa belladonna, a member of the nightshade family. Both toxins cross the blood-brain barrier poorly and were discovered primarily from their influences on postganglionic parasympathetic nervous system functions. Activation of muscarinic AChRs is relatively slow (milliseconds to seconds) and, depending on the subtypes present (M1- M5), they directly alter cellular homeostasis of phospholipase C, inositol trisphosphate, cAMP, and free calcium.",

For instance, concomitant activation of alpha7 nAChRs and NMDA receptors triggers the production of anandamine in postsynaptic neurons (448). Anandamine, then, functions as a retrograde messenger and regulates synaptic transmission by interacting with specific receptors in the presynaptic neurons/terminals (498).",
