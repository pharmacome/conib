SET Evidence="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative
disorder afflicting millions of people. It is
diagnosed by the progressive loss of cognitive function and
behavioral defi cits and is characterized by the presence of
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques, cholinergic
neuron loss, and neuronal atrophy at autopsy"

SET Evidence="NFTs are formed by
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein[7, 8]. Tau is
a microtubule-binding protein whose function is to stabilize
microtubules and facilitate fast axonal transport. Once
highly phosphorylated, tau dissociates from microtubules
and is prone to aggregate, forming paired helical fi laments
that aggregate into NFTs"

SET Evidence="The third important hallmark of AD is cholinergic
hypofunction. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine
(ACh) exerts its physiological functions by activating
either ionotropic nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) or
metabotropic muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs). It has
been reported that in AD brains there are (1) reduced
choline acetyltransferase levels accompanied by decreased
ACh synthesis; (2) significant loss of cholinergic neurons;
(3) reduction in the numbers of postsynaptic neurons
accessible to ACh; (4) cholinergic neuronal and axonal
abnormalities; and (5) reduction in nAChR levels"
