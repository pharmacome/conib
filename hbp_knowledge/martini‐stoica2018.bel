SET Evidence ="Transcriptional levels of TFEB and several of its well-known lysosomal targets were stratified by no demen- tia, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia,these transcript levels positively correlate with cognitive decline"

SET Evidence =". In addition, human brains diagnosed with frontotemporal demen- tia (FTD) demonstrated an increase in transcriptional levels of TFEB and TFEB lysosomal target gene LAMP1"
path(MESH:"Frontotemporal Dementia") -> r(HGNC:TFEB)
path(MESH:"Frontotemporal Dementia") -> r(HGNC:LAMP1)

SET Evidence ="On the protein level, TFEB lysosomal target genes LAMP1 and Cathep- sin D (CTSD) are also increased in the FTD frontal cortex relative to normal subjects, and TFEB protein levels trended increased with statistical significance in the CBD group"

path(MESH:"Frontotemporal Dementia") -> p(HGNC:CTSD)

SET Evidence ="In the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy (Ramsden et al., 2005; SantaCruz et al., 2005), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of microarray data revealed a similar enrichment of TFEB’s tran- scriptional profile when comparing 4-mo-old transgenic mice with widespread NFTs to wild-type mice, indicating TFEB’s activation with tau pathology (Fig. 1 F). "
path(MESH:Tauopathies) -> p(MGI:Tfeb)

SET Evidence ="Examining the protein levels in another tauopathy mouse model, hippocampal lysates from PS19 mice (Yoshiyama et al., 2007) at 10 mo of age showed increases in TFEB and lysosomal proteins LAMP1 and CTSD com- pared with wild-type mice (Fig. S1, G and H)."

a(MESH:astrocytes) -> p(MGI:Tfeb)

SET Evidnece ="as expected, the expression of several TFEB lysosomal target genes was signifi- cantly up-regulated in TFEB-transduced astrocytes, including lysosomal marker LAMP1 and lysosomal proteases, cathepsins A and B"
p(MGI:Tfeb) -> p(MGI:Lamp1)
p(MGI:Tfeb) -> p(MGI:Ctsa)

SET Evidence ="In sum, these results demonstrate that TFEB regulates the lysosomal pathway in primary astrocytes."
SET Cell ="astrocyte"

SET Evdience ="TFEB not only increased the proportion of cells taking up beads, but also increased the pro- portion of cells taking up multiple beads, suggesting an enhanced phagocytic capacity"
p(MGI:Tfeb) -> act(a(MESH:Phagocytes))

SET Evidence ="Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of 12% in the uptake of pffs in TFEB transduced astrocytes relative to control at the 1-h time point, with a 22% relative increase in up- take in the TFEB transduced cells at 4 h"
p(MGI:Tfeb) -> a(HBP:"tau fibrils")

SET Evidence ="Inhibiting mTORC1 blocks the phosphor- ylation of TFEB, allowing unphosphorylated TFEB to translocate to the nucleus and become transcriptionally active"
p(MESH:"Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1") -> p(MGI:Tfeb,pmod(Ph))

SET Evidence =" Flow cytometry revealed that Torin1 treatment of TFEB transduced astrocytes increased dye-conjugated pff uptake 63% relative to EGFP transduced controls as shown by median fluorescence in- tensity, while under basal conditions, the TFEB overexpressing astrocytes increased uptake just 18% relative to EGFP expressing controls (Fig. 2 K). Thus, TFEB enhances phagocytic pathways in astrocytes, in particular increasing the uptake of pffs."

SET Evidence ="qRT-PCR demonstrated undetectable transcript levels of TFEB as well as a reduction in LAMP1 mRNA in TFEB KO astrocytes compared with littermate controls"

SET Evidence =". Recapitulating the uptake assay with dye-conjugated pffs in TFEB KO astrocytes, we observed a modest reduction pff uptake compared with primary astrocytes from littermate controls"
p(MGI:Tfeb) -> a(HBP:"tau fibrils") 

SET Evidence ="Flow cytometry analysis of primary astrocytes incubated with DQ-BSA revealed an ∼60% increase in median fluorescence for TFEB-transduced astro- cytes, indicating that TFEB enhances uptake and proteolysis of DQ-BSA "

SET Evidence =" In sum, these data suggest that TFEB stimulates uptake and trafficking of pffs to the lysosome for degradation."
p(MGI:Tfeb) -> tloc(HBP:"tau fibrils",toloc(MESH:Lsosomes))

SET Evidence =" In addition, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that heparin reduces dye-conjugated pff uptake in both TFEB and EGFP transduced astrocytes, suggesting that macropino- cytosis is responsible for astroglial pff uptake"
