We aimed to study the relationship between YKL-40 and brain structure and its interactions with core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-beta 1-42 [Abeta42], total tau, p-tau, and YKL-40) of 80 cognitively normal controls and 27 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were classified as Abeta42+ (<550 pg/mL) or Abeta42- (>550 pg/mL). CTh difference maps were derived from the interaction and correlation analyses in the whole sample and within clinical groups. There was a strong correlation between YKL-40 and markers of neurodegeneration (total tau and p-tau). In the whole sample, we found a negative correlation between YKL-40 and CTh in AD vulnerable areas in Abeta42+ subjects but not in Abeta42 participants. Our results suggest that YKL-40 could track the inflammatory processes associated to tau-related neurodegeneration in the presence of the AD pathophysiological process."

CALHM1 homomultimerizes, shares strong sequence similarities with the selectivity filter of the NMDA receptor, and generates a large Ca(2+) conductance across the plasma membrane. Importantly, we determined that the CALHM1 P86L polymorphism (rs2986017) is significantly associated with AD in independent case-control studies of 3404 participants (allele-specific OR = 1.44, p = 2 x 10(-10)). We further found that the P86L polymorphism increases Abeta levels by interfering with CALHM1-mediated Ca(2+) permeability. We propose that CALHM1 encodes an essential component of a previously uncharacterized cerebral Ca(2+) channel that controls Abeta levels and susceptibility to late-onset AD."

Alzheimer's disease causes massive axonal disruption and the dislocation of tau protein from its usual axonal domain into neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and presynaptic regions. The normal pattern of axonal staining in cortex is disrupted and white matter staining is reduced. Prominent abnormal tau-immunoreactive neuropil fibers are densely present even in cortical regions without classical neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque formation. The striking neuropil abnormalities, revealed by the aberrant localization of tau protein, are likely to contribute to neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease."

All AD patients and eight healthy controls additionally underwent a [11C]PIB PET scan to measure the cortical Abeta burden. When AD patients were defined on clinical criteria, no difference in cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding between AD patients and healthy controls was found (p = 0.54). However, when individuals were reassigned to groups according to their amyloid status, the PIB-positive individuals had 13% higher 5-HT4 receptor levels than PIB-negative individuals (p = 0.02) and the importance of classification of groups is emphasized. The 5-HT4 receptor binding was a positively correlated to Abeta burden (p = 0.03) and negatively to MMSE score of the AD patients (p = 0.02). Our data suggests that cerebral 5-HT4 receptor upregulation starts at a preclinical stage of and continues while dementia is still at a mild stage, which contrasts other receptor subtypes. We speculate that this may either be a compensatory effect of decreased levels of interstitial 5-HT, an attempt to improve cognitive function, increase acetylcholine release or to counteract Abeta accumulation."

The major A allele in a SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3824968, is associated with an increased AD risk. However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan."

This biological and neuroimaging evidence may suggest that SORL1 rs3824968 is associated with brain morphology in terms of A allele-related volumetric reduction caused by high Abeta load, cardiovascular disease, or both.

Furthermore, oligomeric amyloid beta has also been shown to induce synapse loss and cognitive impairment in animals.

SET Evidence = "There is a strong genetic risk for late-onset AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease (AD), but so far few gene variants have been identified that reliably contribute to that risk. A newly confirmed genetic risk allele C of the clusterin (CLU) gene variant rs11136000 is carried by approximately 88% of Caucasians. The C allele confers a 1.16 greater odds of developing late-onset AD than the T allele. AD patients have reductions in regional white matter integrity. We evaluated whether the CLU risk variant was similarly associated with lower white matter integrity in healthy young humans. Evidence of early brain differences would offer a target for intervention decades before symptom onset. We scanned 398 healthy young adults (mean age 23.6 Ã‚Â± 2.2 years) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a variation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitive to white matter integrity in the living brain. We assessed genetic associations using mixed model regression at each point in the brain to map the profile of these associations with white matter integrity. Each C allele copy of the CLU variant was associated with lower fractional anisotropy (FA) - a widely accepted measure of white matter integrity- in multiple brain regions, including several known to degenerate in AD. These regions included the splenium of the corpus callosum, the fornix, cingulum, and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi in both brain hemispheres. Young healthy carriers of the CLU gene risk variant showed a distinct profile of lower white matter integrity that may increase vulnerability to developing AD later in life."

SET Evidence = " Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related disorder characterized by deposition of Amyloid beta and degeneration of neurons in brain regions such as the hippocampus, resulting in progressive cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of AD is tightly linked to Amyloid beta deposition and oxidative stress, but it remains unclear as to how these factors result in neuronal dysfunction and death. We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta. Our findings suggest a sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in which Amyloid beta induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, resulting in perturbed ceramide and cholesterol metabolism which, in turn, triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that leads to clinical disease."

SET Evidence = "Eleven AD patients and 7 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent combined [Â¹â�¸F]MK-9470 PET and [Â¹Â¹C]PIB PET scans to assess CBâ‚�R availability and amyloid deposition, respectively, and T1 volumetric MRI for partial volume correction. We found no difference in CBâ‚�R availability between AD and HV, VOI-based fractional uptake values (FUR) were 0.043Â±0.01 for AD and 0.045Â±0.01 for controls (p=0.9). CBâ‚�R availability did not correlate with neuropsychological test scores and was not modulated by ApoE genotype. As expected, global [Â¹Â¹C]PIB SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio) was increased in AD (SUVR 1.9Â±0.3) compared to HV (1.2Â±0.1) with p<0.001, but no correlation was found between amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and CBâ‚�R availability."
