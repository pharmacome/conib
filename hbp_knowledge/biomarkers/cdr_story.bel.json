For example, while Ras-dependent signaling is required for promoting or maintaining neuronal differentiation, Dyrk1A modulates ERK activation by interacting with Ras, B-Raf, and MEK1 and by facilitating the formation of a Ras/B-Raf/MEK1 multi-protein complex (Kelly and Rahmani, 2005). Recently, many studies implicated a potential role of Dyrk1A during cell death. For example, Dyrk1A caused the formation of abnormal protein aggregates through the phosphorylation of a-synuclein, APP, and tau. Furthermore, these cells show a marked increase of apoptotic cell death (Park et al., 2007), indicating that the overexpression of Dyrk1A induces cell death",

For example, while Ras-dependent signaling is required for promoting or maintaining neuronal differentiation, Dyrk1A modulates ERK activation by interacting with Ras, B-Raf, and MEK1 and by facilitating the formation of a Ras/B-Raf/MEK1 multi-protein complex (Kelly and Rahmani, 2005). Recently, many studies implicated a potential role of Dyrk1A during cell death. For example, Dyrk1A caused the formation of abnormal protein aggregates through the phosphorylation of a-synuclein, APP, and tau. Furthermore, these cells show a marked increase of apoptotic cell death (Park et al., 2007), indicating that the overexpression of Dyrk1A induces cell death",

      "evidence": "Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) is the mammalian homologue of Drosophila melanogaster minibrain and its human gene is mapped to the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. Dyrk1A phosphorylates several transcription factors, including NFAT and CREB and a number of cytosolic proteins such as APP, tau, and a-synuclein. Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1. These data indicate that Dyrk1A regulates cell death through facilitating ASK1-mediated signaling events.",

Here we report abnormal acetylation of K274 and K281 on tau, identified in AD brains, promotes memory loss and disrupts synaptic plasticity by reducing postsynaptic KIdney/BRAin (KIBRA) protein, a memory-associated protein.acetylated tau reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion. The LTP deficit was rescued by promoting actin polymerization or by KIBRA expression. In AD patients with dementia, we found enhanced tau acetylation is linked to loss of KIBRA. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which pathogenic tau causes synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD pathogenesis.",

Reducing tau levels improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, but the mechanisms regulating the turnover of pathogenic tau are unknown. We found that tau is acetylated and that tau acetylation prevents degradation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Using two antibodies specific for acetylated tau, we showed that tau acetylation is elevated in patients at early and moderate Braak stages of tauopathy. Histone acetyltransferase p300 was involved in tau acetylation and the class III protein deacetylase SIRT1 in deacetylation. Deleting SIRT1 enhanced levels of acetylated-tau and pathogenic forms of p-tau in vivo, likely by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibiting p300 with a small molecule promoted tau deacetylation and eliminated p-tau associated with tauopathy. Modulating tau acetylation could be a new therapeutic strategy to reduce tau-mediated neurodegeneration.",

For example, while Ras-dependent signaling is required for promoting or maintaining neuronal differentiation, Dyrk1A modulates ERK activation by interacting with Ras, B-Raf, and MEK1 and by facilitating the formation of a Ras/B-Raf/MEK1 multi-protein complex (Kelly and Rahmani, 2005). Recently, many studies implicated a potential role of Dyrk1A during cell death. For example, Dyrk1A caused the formation of abnormal protein aggregates through the phosphorylation of a-synuclein, APP, and tau. Furthermore, these cells show a marked increase of apoptotic cell death (Park et al., 2007), indicating that the overexpression of Dyrk1A induces cell death",

      "evidence": "Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, is composed of an inhibitory N-terminal domain, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (Ichijo et al., 1997). ASK1 can promote apoptosis in response to common pro-apoptotic stresses, such as oxidative stress (Song et al., 2002), death receptor ligands (Nishitoh et al., 1998), and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Nishitoh et al., 2002). ASK1 also phosphorylates and activates both p38 and JNK pathways (Ichijo et al., 1997). The mechanism of ASK1 activation is positively regulated by its binding proteins such as TNF receptor-ssociated factors 2/6 (Noguchi et al., 2005) and Daxx (Chang et al., 1998). On the other hand, several cellular proteins, including thioredoxin (Saitoh et al., 1998), Hsp90 (Zhang et al., 2005), and 14-3-3 (Zhang et al., 1999), have been reported to interact with ASK1 and inhibit ASK1 activity.",

The LTP deficit was rescued by promoting actin polymerization or by KIBRA expression. In AD patients with dementia, we found enhanced tau acetylation is linked to loss of KIBRA.

Reducing tau levels improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, but the mechanisms regulating the turnover of pathogenic tau are unknown. We found that tau is acetylated and that tau acetylation prevents degradation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Using two antibodies specific for acetylated tau, we showed that tau acetylation is elevated in patients at early and moderate Braak stages of tauopathy. Histone acetyltransferase p300 was involved in tau acetylation and the class III protein deacetylase SIRT1 in deacetylation. Deleting SIRT1 enhanced levels of acetylated-tau and pathogenic forms of p-tau in vivo, likely by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation.

      "evidence": "KANSL1 is necessary and sufficient for regulating MOF acetyltransferase activity on nucleosome H4. Moreover, it is also required for the specific acetylation of p53 on K120, which is crucial for the differential and optimal transcription activation of p53 target genes, both in vivo and in vitro. BTG2 (B-cell translocation gene 2) is an early growth response gene whose promoter contains p53-binding sites that is strongly regulated by p53. Interestingly, BTG2 is one of the mediators of the p53-dependent inhibition of H-Ras activity, which is involved in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, development, differentiation, senescence and cell death. This gene binds HRas (G12V) and represses its activity by reducing its GTP loading state, which, in turn, activates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade and causes a reduction in the expression of a large number of downstream molecules. Therefore, it is plausible that dysfunction of KANSL1 might perturb the activity of p53 transcription target genes, such as BTG2, producing an aberrant regulation of important downstream cascades of Ras. This mechanism could explain the overlapping phenotypic features observed in the KANSL1 haploinsufficiency phenotype and the RASopathies. Additional clinical and experimental studies will be needed to evaluate this hypothesis and further understand the molecular mechanisms associated with deleterious KANSL1 alleles.",

      "evidence": "KANSL1 is necessary and sufficient for regulating MOF acetyltransferase activity on nucleosome H4. Moreover, it is also required for the specific acetylation of p53 on K120, which is crucial for the differential and optimal transcription activation of p53 target genes, both in vivo and in vitro. BTG2 (B-cell translocation gene 2) is an early growth response gene whose promoter contains p53-binding sites that is strongly regulated by p53. Interestingly, BTG2 is one of the mediators of the p53-dependent inhibition of H-Ras activity, which is involved in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, development, differentiation, senescence and cell death. This gene binds HRas (G12V) and represses its activity by reducing its GTP loading state, which, in turn, activates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade and causes a reduction in the expression of a large number of downstream molecules. Therefore, it is plausible that dysfunction of KANSL1 might perturb the activity of p53 transcription target genes, such as BTG2, producing an aberrant regulation of important downstream cascades of Ras. This mechanism could explain the overlapping phenotypic features observed in the KANSL1 haploinsufficiency phenotype and the RASopathies. Additional clinical and experimental studies will be needed to evaluate this hypothesis and further understand the molecular mechanisms associated with deleterious KANSL1 alleles.",

      "evidence": "KANSL1 is necessary and sufficient for regulating MOF acetyltransferase activity on nucleosome H4. Moreover, it is also required for the specific acetylation of p53 on K120, which is crucial for the differential and optimal transcription activation of p53 target genes, both in vivo and in vitro. BTG2 (B-cell translocation gene 2) is an early growth response gene whose promoter contains p53-binding sites that is strongly regulated by p53. Interestingly, BTG2 is one of the mediators of the p53-dependent inhibition of H-Ras activity, which is involved in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, development, differentiation, senescence and cell death. This gene binds HRas (G12V) and represses its activity by reducing its GTP loading state, which, in turn, activates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade and causes a reduction in the expression of a large number of downstream molecules. Therefore, it is plausible that dysfunction of KANSL1 might perturb the activity of p53 transcription target genes, such as BTG2, producing an aberrant regulation of important downstream cascades of Ras. This mechanism could explain the overlapping phenotypic features observed in the KANSL1 haploinsufficiency phenotype and the RASopathies. Additional clinical and experimental studies will be needed to evaluate this hypothesis and further understand the molecular mechanisms associated with deleterious KANSL1 alleles.",
