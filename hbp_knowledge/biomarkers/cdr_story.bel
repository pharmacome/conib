SET Evidence = "Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) is the mammalian\
homologue of Drosophila melanogaster minibrain and its human gene is mapped to the Down syndrome critical region\
of chromosome 21. Dyrk1A phosphorylates several transcription factors, including NFAT and CREB and a number of\
cytosolic proteins such as APP, tau, and a-synuclein. Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth\
and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly\
understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death.\
In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1).\
Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1.\
These data indicate that Dyrk1A regulates cell death through facilitating ASK1-mediated signaling events."

having DNA binding, ATPase and DNA helicase activities (48). Fe65 was shown to associate with Tip60, and both of\
these proteins colocalize with AICD in the nucleus by forming the AICD-Fe65-Tip60 complex (termed AFT complex)\
(42, 46, 49). In Gal4 reporter gene experiments, co-expression of APP (or AICD), Fe65, and Gal4-Tip60 leads to\
dramatically enhanced expression of Gal4 in the presence of CP2, a transcription factor that interacts with Fe65\
(46). Moreover, Cao and Sudhof (50) reported that gamma-cleavage of APP along with nuclear translocation of Fe65\
are required for transactivation. Meanwhile, the Fe65 adaptor protein has been described to interact with the\
transcription factor CP2 (CP2/ LSF/LBP1) through its PID1 domain (51). The involvement of AICD in the complex was\
confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of AICD with CP2 in the presence of Fe65 (47). This second ternary complex\

Reducing tau levels improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, but the mechanisms\

acetylation prevents degradation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Using two antibodies specific for \

stages of tauopathy. Histone acetyltransferase p300 was involved in tau acetylation and the class\
III protein deacetylase SIRT1 in deacetylation. Deleting SIRT1 enhanced levels of acetylated-tau\

SET Evidence = "KANSL1 is necessary and sufficient for regulating MOF acetyltransferase activity\
on nucleosome H4. Moreover, it is also required for the specific acetylation of p53 on K120, \
which is crucial for the differential and optimal transcription activation of p53 target genes,\
both in vivo and in vitro. BTG2 (B-cell translocation gene 2) is an early growth response\
gene whose promoter contains p53-binding sites that is strongly regulated by p53. \
Interestingly, BTG2 is one of the mediators of the p53-dependent inhibition of H-Ras activity,\
which is involved in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, development,\
differentiation, senescence and cell death. This gene binds HRas (G12V) and represses its \
activity by reducing its GTP loading state, which, in turn, activates the Ras/MAPK signaling \
cascade and causes a reduction in the expression of a large number of downstream molecules.\
Therefore, it is plausible that dysfunction of KANSL1 might perturb the activity of p53 transcription\
target genes, such as BTG2, producing an aberrant regulation of important downstream cascades of Ras.\
This mechanism could explain the overlapping phenotypic features observed in the KANSL1 haploinsufficiency\
phenotype and the RASopathies. Additional clinical and experimental studies will be needed to evaluate\
this hypothesis and further understand the molecular mechanisms associated with deleterious KANSL1 alleles."
