Dysfunction of ERAD, causing ER stress has been shown to occur in mSOD1 containing motor neurones [99], through a mechanism involving Derilin-1, an ERAD-linked protein, subsequent ER stress–induced activation of the ASK1 pathway and ultimately apoptosis [99]. Specifically, mSOD1 was shown to interact with Derilin-1 causing dysregulation of ERAD leading to ER stress–induced ASK1 activation, apoptosis and disease progression (Fig. 3D).",

The cells initial and rapid response to ER stress is the activation of a set of pro-survival signalling pathways termed the UPR. Activation of the UPR causes a shutdown of global protein synthesis and activates mechanisms that allow the cell to deal with the accumulation of unfolded proteins. For example, it enhances the protein folding capacity by increasing the expression of ER chaperones and it up-regulates the degradation of misfolded proteins.",

Presenilin mutations reduced phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2alpha, resulting in failure to attenuate protein synthesis causing protein accumulation in the ER [73].",

Specifically, mSOD1 was shown to interact with Derilin-1 causing dysregulation of ERAD leading to ER stress–induced ASK1 activation, apoptosis and disease progression (Fig. 3D).",
