SET Evidence = " It
has been proposed that such an imbalance may trigger the onset
of many neurodegenerative diseases (10, 26), and recent studies
report that polyglutamine (polyQ)-based aggregates can se-
quester and inhibit the function of a low-abundance cochaper-
one, Sis1p/DNAJB1, in protein degradation (27)."

quester the highly abundant major chaperone heat shock cognate

can be rescued by nominally increasing HSC70 levels."

SET Evidence = ". Be-
yond maintaining the general solubility of the CME machinery,
HSC70 is specifically required for both the disassembly of the
clathrin coat from endocytosed vesicles (20, 29 – 31) and in the
recycling of coat components back to the plasma membrane."

SET Evidence = "Although internalized transferrin levels remained un-
changed in cells with near-normal amounts of HSC70, cells with
over a 50% reduction in HSC70 expression had significant CME
inhibition (compare Fig. 2 E and D ), with a 51 ± 17% decrease in
