SET Evidence = "Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective pathway for lysosomal degradation of long-lived cytosolic proteins, and differs from the other two modes of cytosol-to-lysosome targeting, macro- and micro-autophagy, in that it 1) does not involve vesicle formation, and 2) that specific interactions with a complex of molecular chaperones must occur prior to direct translocation of the substrate protein through the lysosomal membrane (Cuervo 2011)."

SET Evidence = " Furthermore, LAMP2A acts as the rate-limiting step for the activity of the CMA pathway, with rate of the assembly / disassembly of the LAMP2A complex in the lysosomal membrane being paramount for its function (Cuervo and Dice 1996;Bandyopadhyay et al. 2008)."

Although it is maximally activated upon prolonged starvation (Cuervo et al. 1995), CMA activity has been also found specifically upregulated in response to oxidative stress (Hubbi et al. 2013; Kiffin 2004), genotoxic insult (Park et al. 2015), and - in a compensatory fashion - upon impaired macroautophagy (Koga et al. 2011a)"

SET Evidence = " LAMP2A down-regulation decreased total lysosomal proteolysis (NH4Cl-sensitive) as well as CMA-dependent proteolysis [(NH4Cl-3MA)-sensitive], without affecting macroautophagy-dependent (3MA-sensitive) proteolysis, further verifying the importance of LAMP2A as the ratelimiting step of the CMA pathway in this culture system (Suppl. Fig. 1A-C). LC3 lipidation and macroautophagic substrate SQSTM1/p62 abundance was similarly unchanged (Suppl. Fig. 1D)."

Other proteins with higher overall accumulation reported in the MS/MS-analysis following LAMP2A downregulation, including canonical CMA substrate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and prohibitin (PHB), were also investigated at the biochemical level for assay validation purposes (Suppl.
