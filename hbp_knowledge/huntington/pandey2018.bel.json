Reducing HTT expression decreased optineurin interaction in Golgi apparatus hints that HTT may also regulate dynamics of autophagosome through its interaction with optineurin (Toro et al. 2009). Autophagosomes in neurons under basal conditions are generated at distal axons and are retrogradely trafficked to the cell body. Silencing of htt blocks the retrograde transport of autophagosomes along the axon (Wong and Holzbaur 2014). Similar defects were observed with mutant htt, which led to inefficient clearance ofmutant htt, suggesting that htt may regulate its own clearance.",

      "evidence": "Studies also suggest that wild-type htt may play a significant role in autophagy. Reducing HTT expression decreased optineurin interaction in Golgi apparatus hints that HTT may also regulate dynamics of autophagosome through its interaction with optineurin (Toro et al. 2009). Autophagosomes in neurons under basal conditions are generated at distal axons and are retrogradely trafficked to the cell body. Silencing of htt blocks the retrograde transport of autophagosomes along the axon (Wong and Holzbaur 2014). Similar defects were observed with mutant htt, which led to inefficient clearance ofmutant htt, suggesting that htt may regulate its own clearance.",
