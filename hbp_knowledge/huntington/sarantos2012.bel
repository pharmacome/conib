SET Evidence = "We have developed an assay for mutant huntingtin-mediated cell death in ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells that measures loss of viability upon serum withdrawal [12,14]. After 24 hours of serum withdrawal, ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells show a marked decrease in ATP levels while ST Hdh Q7/Q7 cells [18] are not significantly affected (Fig. 1 A )."

SET Evidence = "Using the Prestwick Chemical Library consisting of 1120 approved drugs and pharmacologically active small molecules, we performed a screen to identify compounds that could enhance ATP levels in ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells during serum withdrawal."

SET Evidence = "As shown in Figure 1 B , these drugs restored ATP levels in ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells after serum withdrawal in a dose-dependent manner."

SET Evidence = "The ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells have significantly higher caspase-3/7 activity after 24 hours of serum withdrawal compared to the ST Hdh Q7/Q7 cells or compared to ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells in serum (Figure 1 C )."

SET Evidence = " Caspase activation in the ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells was significantly blocked by the addition of the pizotifen, cyproheptadine, or loxapine in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1 D , compound structures 1E)."

SET Evidence = "Addition of pizotifen, cyproheptadine, or loxapine to the ST Hdh Q7/Q7 cells after serum withdrawal had no effect on ATP levels, indicating that the drugs do not have a general effect on viability but rather correct a deficit specific to the ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells (Figure 2 A )."

SET Evidence = "This activity also appears to be specific to ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells challenged with serum withdrawal since the addition of the compound pizotifen to the ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells in serum had no effect on ATP levels (Figure 2 B )."

SET Evidence = "To determine downstream signaling events and mechanisms of action, we measured the effect of these three drugs on ERK phosphorylation. A significant increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1 (p44) occurred after a 15-min treatment with pizotifen, cyproheptadine, or loxapine in both ST Hdh Q111/Q111 and ST Hdh Q7/Q7 cells (Figure 3 A )."

SET Evidence = " A significant increase in phospho-ERK2 (p42) occurred after treatment with pizotifen and loxapine and an upward trend occurred after treatment with cyproheptadine in ST Hdh Q111/Q111cells. Pizotifen treatment significantly increased phospho-ERK2 in ST Hdh Q7/Q7 cells (Figure 3B)."

SET Evidence = "We measured the time-course of pizotifen-induced ERK activation under conditions of serum withdrawal in ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells and found significant increases in phosphoERK1/2 after five and fifteen minutes of treatment (Figure 3 C,D)."

SET Evidence = "PhosphoERK1/2 levels in DMSO control cells increased slowly with time and were approximately equal between pizotifen and control cells after 24 hours of treatment."

SET Evidence = "To determine if transient pizotifen-induced ERK phosphorylation is necessary for rescue of mutant Htt toxicity, we blocked ERK phosphorylation by co-treatment with MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126."

SET Evidence = "Inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of pizotifen prevented the rescue of ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells in the ATP assay (Figure 4 C )."

SET Evidence = "Pizotifen is a serotonin antagonist used to treat recurrent migraine [22]. It binds to over 30 receptors, including subtypes of the serotonin, dopamine, histamine, adrenoreceptor, and cholinergic receptors (for binding profile, see Young et. al. [19])"

SET Evidence = "In addition, pizotifen has been shown to be a partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor. Agonism was reportedly blocked by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100,635 [23]. WAY-100,635 also blocks the activation of ERK by several antipsychotic drugs that are agonists of the 5-HT1A receptor, as well as the activation of ERK through the 5-HT1A endogenous ligand serotonin [24]."

SET Evidence = "Another 5-HT1A antagonist, NAD-299, exhibits a pharmacological profile similar to WAY-100,635 [25], with both WAY-100,635 and NAD-299 showing high selectivity for the 5-HT1A receptor (binding it with nanomolar affinities)."

SET Evidence = "To determine if we had overlooked other active compounds from the Prestwick library, we retested risperidone, metergoline, ketanserin, spiperone, and promethazine. These drugs have overlapping targets with pizotifen and are known to act through serotonin receptors [20, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]."

SET Evidence = "One drug, promethazine, rescued ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells (Figure 5). Promethazine is also a high affinity antagonist of the H1 receptor and has previously been reported to rescue an HD model [34]."

SET Evidence = "Cetirizine, diphenhydramine, ketotifen, desloratadine, and chlorphreniramine failed to rescue ST Hdh Q111/Q111 cells (Figure 6). This suggests that the activity of the drugs in the cell-based assay is not related solely to their common ability to block the H1 receptor."

SET Evidence = "The lack of effect on open-field behavior suggests that the improved rotarod performance is not simply due to acute effects on activity levels but instead to improved motor coordination."

SET Evidence = "Mutant Htt causes the down-regulation of the dopamine- and cAMP-regulated 32-kDa phosphoprotein DARPP-32. DARPP-32 is involved in dopamine and serotonin signaling, is highly expressed in the striatum and prefrontal cortex and is a marker of neuronal dysfunction in HD mice [35,36]."

SET Evidence = "By immunohistochemistry (IHC), we found that levels of DARPP-32 in the striatum of the HD transgenic R6/2 mice were reduced at 10 weeks of age qualitatively. Pizotifen treatment increased DARPP-32 staining in the striatum at this time point (Figure 8 A )."

SET Evidence = "By immunoblot analysis, we observed reduced levels of DARPP-32 in the prefrontal cortex of the HD transgenic R6/2 mice at 10 weeks of age and pizotifen treatment increased DARPP-32 levels (Figure 8 B,C)"

SET Evidence = "At 12-weeks of age, the pizotifen treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in striatal DARPP-32 levels when compared to untreated R6/2 controls (Figure 8C)."

SET Evidence = "We evaluated several of the well-characterized receptors that are altered in HD including D2DR, GAD65/67, GluR2/3 and 5HT1B."

SET Evidence = "The levels of mGluR2/3 in HD transgenic R6/2 mice at 10 weeks of age were slightly reduced and pizotifen treatment modestly increased levels of this receptor."

SET Evidence = "D2DR, GAD65/67 and 5HT1B levels are also altered in the HD transgenic R6/2 mice, but pizotifen treatment did not normalize the levels (data not shown)."

SET Evidence = "We confirmed that the striatal area was reduced in the striatum of the HD transgenic R6/2 mice at 10 weeks of age and found that pizotifen treatment attenuated this reduction in striatal area (Figure 8 D )."

SET Evidence = "Taken together, results demonstrating that pizotifen can partially normalize levels of DARPP-32 while increasing striatal area indicate that the correction of motor deficits in the R6/2 mouse by pizotifen is likely due to neuroprotective effects of the drug."

SET Evidence = "We did not detect any changes in the levels of Htt protein or localization in the R6/2 mouse model suggesting that the mechanism is not mediated through clearance pathways (Figure 9, and data not shown)."

SET Evidence = "At 10 weeks of age, we observed that levels of activated ERK2 (p42) were increased in the striatum of the pizotifen-treated HD transgenic R6/2 mice both by IHC and western blotting (Figure 10 A, C)."

SET Evidence = "Interestingly, western blotting analysis showed that the levels of phospho-ERK1 (p44) are significantly reduced in the cortex of the HD transgenic R6/2 mice at 10 weeks of age with pizotifen treatment (Figure 10 B )."

SET Evidence = "The activated ERK by IHC was demonstrated by an increased number of neurons staining positive for phospho-ERK qualitatively (Figure 10C)."

SET Evidence = "These results show that pizotifen can activate striatal ERK1/2 in vitro and in viv o, suggesting that the motor and neuropathological improvements observed in the R6/2 mouse may be mechanistically related to the rescue observed in the cell model."

SET Evidence = "The lower levels of phospho-ERK1 (p44) in the cortex may reflect distinct signaling pathways in these two regions of the brain in response to pizotifen."

SET Evidence = "Additionally, it appears that the ERK pathway is activated in the striatum of R6/2 mice, while in the cortex it is inhibited."
