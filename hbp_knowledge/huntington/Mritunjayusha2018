transport of proteins and other molecules
(Grima et al. 2017; Gasset-Rosa et al. 2017)."

SET Evidence = "HTT is subjected to multiple posttranslational
modificationswhich include phosphorylation, acetylation,
palmitoylation, ubiquitinylation and sumoylation."

SET Evidence = "HTT interacts
with HIP 14 and HIP14L that belong to the family
of palmitoyl-acyl transferases (Yanai et al. 2006). HTT
is palmitoylated at C214 and its polyQ expansion leads
to a reduction in the enzymatic activity of HIP 14 and
of its auto palmitoylation (Huang et al. 2011) leading to
the enzymatic activity of HIP 14 on other substrates and
therefore, regulate intracellular trafficking and synaptic
localization of other neuronal proteins."

SET Evidence = "Autophagy is an important cellular process which is
responsible for the removal of damaged organelles and
aggregated proteins by delivering them to lysosomes for
degradation. Autophagy defects have been consistently
observed in HD (Steffan 2010; Martin et al. 2015). High
amount of autophagosome formation a reduced capacity
to degrade aggregated proteins and organelles has
been found in HD models (Martin et al. 2015)."

SET Evidence = "Studies
also suggest that wild-type htt may play a significant
role in autophagy. Reducing HTT expression decreased
optineurin interaction in Golgi apparatus hints that HTT
may also regulate dynamics of autophagosome through its
interaction with optineurin (Toro et al. 2009). Autophagosomes
in neurons under basal conditions are generated
at distal axons and are retrogradely trafficked to the cell
body. Silencing of htt blocks the retrograde transport of
autophagosomes along the axon (Wong and Holzbaur
2014). Similar defects were observed with mutant htt,
which led to inefficient clearance ofmutant htt, suggesting
that htt may regulate its own clearance."

SET Evidence = "mutant htt has been found to activate autophagy by
sequestering and inactivating mTOR leading to an induction
of autophagy (Ravikumar et al. 2004). Themechanistic
defects in autophagy in HD are exaggerated by mutant
htt. Mutant htt results in defective autophagy mediated
degradation and aggregate formation,which leads to compensatory
upregulation of autophagy and accumulation
of mutant htt and neurotoxicity. Further due to decreased
cargomovement of autophagosome to fuse with lysosomes
leading to defective autophagy (Wong and Holzbaur
2014)."

SET Evidence = "In the caudate nucleus of HD patients, mRNA expression
of LC3A, ULK2, and LAMP2 is significantly increased
whereas; PINK1, WDFY3 and FK506 binding protein
1A are significantly decreased. These findings suggest that
the increased expression of LC3A and ULK2 correlate
to early autophagy induction and autophagosome formation
in HD (Martinez-Vicente et al. 2010)."

SET Evidence = "A decrease in
PINK1 expression induces mitochondrial fragmentation
and mitophagy (Kamat et al. 2014).HDis associated with
increased mitochondrial fragmentation and inefficient corporation
of mitochondria into autophagosomes (Wong
and Holzbaur 2014)."

SET Evidence = "HTThas been found to be involved in a variety of vesicular
trafficking in neurons including synaptic precursor vesicles
(Zala et al. 2013), autophagosomes (Wong and Holzbaur
2014), lysosomes (Liot et al. 2013), BDNF-containing vesicles
(Gauthier et al. 2004) and GABA-containing vesicles
(Twelvetrees et al. 2010)."

SET Evidence = "HTT is also found to interact with
several proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
(Legendre-Guillemin et al. 2002). HTT also activated
GTPaseRab11 that participates in vesicle recycling during
endocytosis (Li et al. 2008)."

SET Evidence = "Evidences suggest that HTT is required for ciliogenesis
(Haremaki et al. 2015).HTTis found at the base of the cilia
in neurons, photoreceptor cilia, and cilia in multiciliated
cells (Keryer et al. 2011). Absence of HTT from mouse
cells impairs the retrograde trafficking of the pericentriolar
material 1 protein and the primary cilium is not formed."

SET Evidence = "Post-mortem samples from HD brain and transgenic
mouse models show transcriptional dysregulation (Valor
2015). Wild-type htt binds to several transcription factors
including CREB-binding protein (Steffan et al. 2000),
p53 tumour suppressor, nuclear factor-κB (Takano and
Gusella 2002), PPAR-γ, vitamin D receptor, thyroid hormone
receptor-α1 (Futter et al. 2009)."

SET Evidence = "RNA seq data
from myeloid cells of HD patients revealed increases in
proinflammatory cytokines in resting stage which indicates
abnormal basal activation to an exaggerated immune
response to a stimulus (Miller et al. 2016). In anotherRNA
seq study from HD brain samples, it was found that there
was upregulation of developmental homeobox genes and
neuroinflammatory genes (Labadorf et al. 2015)."

SET Evidence = "Multiple
studies related to transcriptional dysregulation inHDsamples
reveal changes in inflammatory responses regulated
by NF-kB, metabolic homeostasis related to mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation and developmental genes
related to neuronal growth and cell cycle regulation."

SET Evidence = "Mutant htt is prone to aggregate formation whose
soluble and insoluble forms are neurotoxic to cells. Such
misfolded forms of proteins are regulated by different proteostasis
mechanisms such as chaperone-mediated folding
or degraded by ubiquitin-mediated degradation or by
lysosomal-autophagy degradation (figure 1). However,
the increasing load of chaperons found in inclusion
bodies such Hsp70 and ubiquitin related protein degradation
machinery or accumulation of autophagosome
related target proteins lead to altered proteostasis."

SET Evidence = "The
expanded polyQ fibrils can deregulate proteostasis nodes
by sequestering transcription factors (Suhr et al. 2001)
or physically obstruct neuronal extensions (Gunawardena
et al. 2003)."

SET Evidence = "Cerebellar neurons have been
observed to induce Hsp70 expression upon mutant htt
expression. However, striatal neurons cannot upregulate
their chaperone expression to overcome this proteostasis
stress (Tagawa et al. 2007). It is also possible that distinct
nodes of proteostasis may have unique ways of handling
proteostatic stress in HD."

SET Evidence = "The cardinal features of HD like (i) movement disorder
characterized initially by chorea and later by dystonia
and parkinsonism, (ii) progressive cognitive decline and
disordered behaviour, and (iii) depression and agitation
appear mostly during adulthood and progress relentlessly
leading to functional disability."

SET Evidence = "Parkinsonism is frequently
observed in the rare juvenile form, slowing saccadic movements
of the eye and possible cerebellar dysfunction helps
in differential diagnosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are
common and do not show increased progression with disease
severity."

SET Evidence = "Most of the symptomatic drugs are directed against
chorea, which is the most conspicuous feature of the disease.
These drugs either deplete dopamine reserves or
block the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, thereby
providing temporary relief to the patient. Reserpine, tetrabenazine
(a short-acting reserpine analogue), phenothiazines
(such as chlorpromazines) and butyrophenones (such as haloperidol) have been used extensively for symptomatic
relief in HD (Marsden 1973)."

SET Evidence = "In a double-blind
crossover trial involving four treatments of haloperidol,
haloperidol and lithium carbonate, lithium carbonate and
placebo carried out for threeweeks, none of the treatments
provided effective relief from choreiform movements."

SET Evidence = "Psychological
variables like levels of irritability, outbursts of
anger and depression did appear to have some effect due to
these drugs.While threeHDpatients showed some relief in
haloperidol and lithium carbonate combination, the other
three did not show any significant relief. Haloperidol itself
increased the levels of depression when compared to other
combinations including placebo (Leonard et al. 1975)."

SET Evidence = "In
another study, 18 patients with Huntington’s chorea were
examined before and after treatment with three neuroleptic
drugs, pimozide, haloperidol and tiapride. Pimozide and
haloperidol gave relief from hyperkinesias but none of the
drug improved motor performance significantly (Girotti
et al. 1984)."

SET Evidence = "In an interesting study, HD patients having
gait abnormalities and choreiform movements were
treated with haloperidol. Although, there was a decrease
in choreiform movement, yet it did not correct gait abnormalities
(Koller and Trimble 1985). Long-term treatment
of haloperidol is knownto cause aggravated parkinsonism,
tardive dyskinesis, difficulties in swallowing and dysphasia
(Emerich et al. 1991)."

SET Evidence = "Tetrabenazine, an inhibitor of
vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) leading to
depletion of dopamine and other monoamines like serotonin
and norepinephrine in the central nervous system has
been used extensively in hyperkinetic disorders, especially
HD."

SET Evidence = "In an open labelled study described by Kenney et al.
(2007), over 400 patients suffering fromhyperkineticmovement
disorders including 98HDpatients were treatedwith
tetrabenazine at the Baylor College of Medicine Parkinson’s
Disease Center and Movement Disorders Clinic.
There was a marked improvement in patients with choreiform
movements."

SET Evidence = "Based on the chorea
score of the UHDRS, tetrabenazine was found to significantly
reduce chorea."

SET Evidence = "GABAergic strategies have included
muscimol, a potent GABA mimetic agonist (Shoulson
et al. 1978). In this double-blind study,muscimol treatment
did not lead to any improvement in motor and cognitive
deficits in 10HDpatients. However, administration of
muscimol ameliorated chorea in the most severely affected
hyperkinetic patients. It also heightened dystonia, particularly
in the early onset patients who had predominant
parkinsonism and dystonic features."

SET Evidence = "Fluoxetine, an SSRI that is widely
used as an antidepressant has been shown to be effective in
HD transgenic mice (Grote et al. 2005) but when administered
in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial of this medication in depressed and nondepressedHD
patients, no differences between the treatment groups were
found in total functional capacity, neurological, or cognitive
ratings (Como et al. 1997)."

SET Evidence = "Pridopidine, a dopamine
D2 receptor antagonist was tested in three large multicentre
clinical trials of HD which has been published
(Lundin et al. 2010; de Yebenes et al. 2011; Huntington
StudyGroupHART Investigators 2013)."

SET Evidence = "Neuroprotective therapy is targeted at the level of genetic
aetiology to slow down the progressive nature of the disease.
Most of the drugs tested in this case have been
targeted at the level of oxidative metabolism or glutamate
transmission because of the metabolic decrease in activity
or increased excitotoxic mechanisms in HD."

SET Evidence = "Coenzyme Q10, a principle mitochondrial cofactor
involved in complex-I activity has been studied as a neuroprotective
agent in HD animal models (Matthews et al.
1998). In a multicentre, parallel group, double blind,
randomized clinical trial on coenzyme Q10 along with
ramacemide (NMDA antagonist) in early HD patients,
conducted by Huntington Study Group (2001), neither
remacemide nor coenzymeQ10, produced significant slowing
in functional decline in early HD even after 30
months. To add to these negative data, there was an
increased frequency of nausea, vomiting and dizziness with
remacemide; and increased frequency of stomach upset
with coenzyme Q10."

SET Evidence = "Creatine is a naturally
occurring compound that, through its intermediate
phosphocreatine, provides a necessary cellular reserve of
high energy phosphates. There is a strong evidence to suggest
that a bioenergetic defect exists in HD as discussed
earlier. Creatine supplementation is intended to augment
cerebral reserves of phosphates and thereby reduce neuronal
metabolic and oxidative stress, and to slow down
neurodegeneration."

SET Evidence = "Verbessem and colleagues treated 26 HD
patients with 5mg/kg creatine and 15 patientswith placebo
for one year and found no significant differences in measures
of strength, neurological status, or cognitive function (Verbessem et al. 2003)."

SET Evidence = "In an interesting study, Bender and
colleagues usedmagnetic resonance spectroscopy to examine
the levels of glutamate in HD patients treated with 20
g/day for 5 days, followed by 6 g/day for 8–10 weeks. They
demonstrated a significant reduction in glutamate levels
in the parietooccipital cortex. This is of great significance
because glutamate release and excitotoxicity are enhanced
by energy deficiency and are considered to play an important
role in the pathogenesis of HD (Bender et al. 2005)."

SET Evidence = "Identification of peripheral markers or neurochemical
agents such as BDNF, 8-OHdG and interleukins
or other molecules that could also help in finding the efficacy
and tracking down the neuroprotective role of drugs
in clinics (Ross and Tabrizi 2011)."
