brains of 116-week-old wild-type, Tg APPsw and Tg
PS1/APPsw mice using high-resolution confocal micros-

(Fig. 1b-e) exhibit an increased Iba-1 and GFAP reactiv-
ity compared to wild-type littermates (Fig. 1a). Moreo-
ver,wild-type some of the activated amoeboid microglia
that are observed in transgenic mice are also strongly
