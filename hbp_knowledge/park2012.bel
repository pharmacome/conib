phosphorylation of GSK3b at Ser9 (Fig. 4D and Supplemen- tary Material, S6A), indicating that AK1 may regulate GSK3b activity. "

SET Evidence ="As shown in Figure 5A and B, treatment of control cells with Ab42 reduced the levels of AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 and the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3b at Ser9. On the contrary, these alterations triggered by Ab42 were not observed in SH-SY5Y/AK1 knockdown cells, showing no changes in the levels of the phosphorylated AMPK and GSK3b. These results suggest that AK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of AMPK and GSK3b in the neuronal cells exposed to Ab42."

increased the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3b and reduced tau phosphorylation at Ser396/404 in SH-SY5Y cells and cortical neurons"
