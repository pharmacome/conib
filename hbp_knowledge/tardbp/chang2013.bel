SET Evidence = "Oxidation of cysteines located at RRM1 and RRM2 decreased protein solubility by promoting the formation of inter- and intra-molecular disulfide linkage [16], providing a strong link between inclusion
formation and direct protein oxidation."

SET Evidence = "Oxidized TDP-43 also lost the ability to inhibit splicing, suggesting that oxidation of TDP-43
is a loss-of-function event."

SET Evidence = "Between the two cysteines, Cys173 showed much stronger perturbation than Cys175, and since the soluble protein was primarily oxidized at a single cysteine (Fig. 2C), these results strongly suggested that Cys173 is preferentially oxidized over Cys175."
