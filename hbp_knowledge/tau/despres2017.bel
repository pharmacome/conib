forms abundant fibers detectable by thioflavin fluorescence or electron microscopy (Figs. 2 and 4) suggests the initial
turn-like structure induced by the phosphorylation of only Ser202 and Thr205 is protective against aggregation."

sufficient to induce aggregation without the addition of any exogenous aggregation inducer."
