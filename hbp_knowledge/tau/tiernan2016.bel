SET Evidence="However, the rate of polymerization
(kapparent) did not differ between hT40 tau and S422E tau. At 360 min,
a similar intensity of light scattering was observed for hT40 (122.5 ±
1.2) and S422E tau (134.5±1.7) indicating that the extent of aggregate
formation was comparable between these two proteins. ThS fluorescence,
measured at 360min, alsowas comparable between hT40 aggregates
(946.4 ± 73.8) and S422E aggregates (927.9 ± 63.7)."

p(HGNC:MAPT) -> a(HBP:"Tau aggregates")
p(HGNC:MAPT, var("p.S422E")) -> a(HBP:"Tau aggregates")

SET Evidence="For both
tau constructs, there were significantly more oligomer-type aggregates
than short or long filaments formed, but no significant difference
between the numbers of short or long filament (Fig. 2E;
F(2,12) = 86.64, p b 0.0001). S422E did not differ significantly from
hT40 in the number of oligomers, short filaments, or long filaments
formed (F(1,12) = 0.05, p = 0.83)."

p(HGNC:MAPT) -> a(HBP:"Tau oligomers")
p(HGNC:MAPT, var("p.S422E")) -> a(HBP:"Tau oligomers")

SET Evidence="Compared to monomers, aggregation significantly increased
PAD exposure for both hT40 and S422E samples (Fig. 3B;
F(1,12) = 685.8, p b 0.0001), as indicated by increased TNT1 reactivity.
Aggregation also significantly increased oligomer formation
(TOC1 reactivity) compared to monomers in both hT40 and S422E
samples (Fig. 3C; F(1,12) = 109.3, p b 0.0001)."
#Discuss: PAD exposure

composite(p(HGNC:MAPT), a(HBP:"Tau aggregates")) -> a(HBP:"Tau oligomers")

SET Evidence="In contrast,
aggregation of either hT40 or S422E significantly increased
the amount of SDS-stable dimers at 180 kDa (Fig. 4C; F(1,12) =
110.0; p b 0.0001), as compared to the levels of these species in the
respective monomer samples. Furthermore, S422E aggregation significantly
increased the amount of SDS-stable dimers compared to
hT40 aggregation (p = 0.03)."

SET Evidence="As previously reported, perfusion
of hT40 monomer had no effect on the rate of anterograde FAT
in the squid axoplasm (Fig. 5A), whereas perfusion of hT40 aggregates
significantly inhibited anterograde FAT as compared to hT40
monomer (Fig. 5B; Fig. 6A; p = 0.003) (LaPointe et al., 2009b).
Neither hT40 monomers nor hT40 aggregates altered the rate of retrograde
FAT (Fig. 5A, B; Fig. 6B)."

SET Evidence="In contrast to hT40 monomer,
perfusion of S422E monomer selectively inhibited anterograde
transport (Fig. 5C; Fig. 6A; p = 0.028), but not retrograde FAT. Surprisingly,
aggregated S422E significantly inhibited both anterograde
and retrograde FAT rates (Fig. 5D; Fig. 6A, B) compared to S422E
monomer (anterograde, p = 0.012; retrograde, p = 0.002) and
hT40 aggregates (retrograde only, p = 0.019)."

SET Evidence="Staining in fixed tissue sections
confirmed several previous reports (Kanaan et al., 2016; Mufson et al.,
2014; Patterson et al., 2011a) that pS422 (Fig. 7A) extensively colocalizes
with TNT1 (Fig. 7B) and TOC1 (Fig. 7C) in both control and AD
brains, despite the relatively sparse appearance of tau pathology in the
temporal cortices of control cases (data not shown)."

SET Evidence="The amount of total tau captured with
pS422 (detected with the pan-tau antibody, Tau5) was significantly
higher in AD compared to control (Fig. 7E; t10 = 6.07, p = 0.0001).
The level of pS422 tau that also contained PAD exposed tau (i.e., TNT1
reactive) was significantly higher in AD compared to control (Fig. 7F;
t10 = 2.31, p = 0.0435). Similarly, the level of pS422 tau that also
contained an oligomeric conformation (i.e., TOC1 reactive) was significantly
higher in AD compared to control (Fig. 7G; t10 = 1.51, p =
0.0029)."
