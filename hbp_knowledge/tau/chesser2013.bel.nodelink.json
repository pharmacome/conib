      "evidence": " However, another study, also using HEK cells and ubiquitin K48 and K63 mutants, demonstrated that in the presence of the E3 ligase CHIP, tau could be ubiquitylated by both K48 and K63 linkages (100). The likelihood that in vivo tau can be ubiquitylated in multiple ways is supported by studies showing tau isolated from NFTs in human brain has several forms of ubiquitin linkages as well as mono-ubiquitylation (101, 102). These data suggest that the physical structure of the ubiquitin chain is unlikely to be a sufficient signal for selectively targeting tau to either the proteasome or autophagy.",

The preferential degradation of specific phospho-forms of tau by a particular pathway has been reported in other studies as well. ",
