The whole range of Tau species was immunoprecipitated (IP) from protein extracts with the Tau-5 antibody, which recognizes amino acid residues 218–225. As shown by WB analysis (Fig. S1), Tau-5 IP allows the purification of full-length Tau (FL-Tau) as well as N- and C-terminally truncated Tau and aggregated species, which display lower and higher molecular weights, respectively. These new N-terminal sites were scattered across the Tau sequence (Fig. 1D), and except for Ala2, have not been described before.",

Immunoaffinity purification and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PHF tau contains epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in parietal and frontal cortex in AD. In control cases with NFT present in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, indicative of Braak and Braak stage II, epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds were present in PHF tau in parietal and frontal cortex, despite the lack of microscopically detectable NFT or senile plaques in these cortical regions. The presence of PHF tau with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in brain regions devoid of NFT in stage II (but regions, which would be expected to contain NFT in stage III) suggests that these bonds occur early in the formation of NFT.",

The occipital cortex, an area spared from neurofibrillary pathology in PSP, showed no detectable cross-linking of PHF-tau protein in either PSP cases or control cases. Double-label immunofluorescence demonstrated the colocalization of the cross-link and PHF-tau in NFT in pons of PSP Previous studies and present data are consistent with the hypothesis that transglutaminase-induced cross-linking may be a factor contributing to the abnormal polymerization and stabilization of tau in straight and PHFs leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation in neurodegenerative diseases, including PSP and AD.",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

FKBP12 also restored the oligomer of the peptide to its monomeric status. Mutational studies on the catalytic center of FKBP12 indicated that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP12 was essential for prevention of aggregation. Assuming that the propensity of aggregation of the peptide is different in each cis-/trans-isomer, we propose that the aggregation behavior of the R3 peptide can be theoretically described with a simple kinetic scheme, in which only the cis-isomer can aggregate and FKBP12 catalyzes isomerization of the peptide in both the monomeric and aggregative states.",

It resides within the “PHF6” motif of the MTBR, which has been reported to mediate the aggregation propensity of recombinant monomeric tau in vitro [6, 37]. Other methylation sites within the MTBR include K259, K290, and K353, each of which lies in a KXGS motif associated with AMP-activated protein kinase mediated regulation of microtubule binding [38]. Within the N-terminal projection domain, Lys methylation was detected at K24, K44, K67, and K190 (Fig. 1).",

Immunoaffinity purification and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PHF tau contains epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in parietal and frontal cortex in AD. In control cases with NFT present in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, indicative of Braak and Braak stage II, epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds were present in PHF tau in parietal and frontal cortex, despite the lack of microscopically detectable NFT or senile plaques in these cortical regions. The presence of PHF tau with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in brain regions devoid of NFT in stage II (but regions, which would be expected to contain NFT in stage III) suggests that these bonds occur early in the formation of NFT.",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads.

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

S-nitrosylated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) promoted the acetylation and activation of the acetyltransferase p300 and facilitated the nitrosylation and inactivation of the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The abundance of GAPDH-SNO was increased in postmortem brain samples from AD patients. Preventing the increase in GAPDH-SNO abundance in both cultured neurons and mice, either by overexpression of the nitrosylation mutant of GAPDH (GAPDH C150S) or by treatment with the GAPDH nitrosylation inhibitor CGP3466B (also known as omigapil), abrogated Aβ1-42-induced tau acetylation, memory impairment, and locomotor dysfunction in mice, suggesting that this drug might be repurposed to treat patients with AD.",

Intriguingly, it has been proposed that a genetic impairment in the OGA gene results in proteasomal dysfunction through a lack of hydrolysis of the inhibitory O-GlcNAc residues of the 19S regulatory cap. Indeed, the OGA gene is located in the 10q locus [127,128], a chromosomal region frequently mutated in AD. The impairment of OGA in AD and the subsequent static OGlcNAcylation of the proteasome may explain why the latter fails to degrade neuronal aggregates. In addition, it has been reported that OGlcNAcylation reduces the sensitivity of intracellular proteins to proteasomal degradation by directly modifying them [43,129,130]. The two phenomena could thus act synergistically: a protein could escape degradation by means of its own O-GlcNAcylation and by the inhibitory effect of glycosylation on the proteasome, leading to a considerable decrease in the turnover of proteins that in turn may aggregate and cause neuronal death.",

The whole range of Tau species was immunoprecipitated (IP) from protein extracts with the Tau-5 antibody, which recognizes amino acid residues 218–225. As shown by WB analysis (Fig. S1), Tau-5 IP allows the purification of full-length Tau (FL-Tau) as well as N- and C-terminally truncated Tau and aggregated species, which display lower and higher molecular weights, respectively. These new N-terminal sites were scattered across the Tau sequence (Fig. 1D), and except for Ala2, have not been described before.",

In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

      "evidence": "The N-terminus of β-catenin has phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation sites that regulate its stability and signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are constitutively phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). β-Catenin phosphorylated at these sites is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which results in ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation. We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation. Lys49 acetylation results in decreased ubiquitination of β-catenin in the presence of proteasome inhibition. While increased Lys49 acetylation does not affect total levels of β-catenin, it results in increased membrane localization of β-catenin.",

In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads. Intriguingly, although Tau-nY29 stains both the neuronal and glial tau pathology of Pick disease, it detects only the neuronal pathology in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy without labeling the predominant glial pathology.",

These 4 markers are particularly useful in understanding potential posttraumatic events in CTE because PAD exposure impairs axonal transport (24), oligomers confer toxicity (28, 38–40), pS422 correlates with cognitive decline (15), and D421 truncated tau may be related to cell toxicity (41, 42). All 3 early tau markers (ie, TNT1, TOC1, and pS422) were present in CTE and displayed extensive colocalization in perivascular tau lesions that are considered diagnostic for CTE.",

      "evidence": "Filamentous, but not soluble, forms of wild-type tau inhibit anterograde, kinesin-based fast axonal transport (FAT) by activating axonal protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), independent of microtubule binding. Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

In contrast, larger aggregates of tau could bind heparin in the extracellular matrix and be internalized through macropinocytosis [170]. As a result of exocytosis and endocytosis, the spreading of tau can occur in various neurodegenerative diseases (tauopathies) including AD. Three plausible mechanisms of tau spreading are shown schematically in Figure 6. Additionally, it appears that microglial cells may facilitate tau propagation by phagocytosis and exocytosis of tau protein [171].",

Tau phosphorylation of Ser-324 (pSer-324) has not previously been evaluated in the context of tauopathy, and here we observed increased deposition of pSer-324-positive tau both in mouse models of tauopathy and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings uncover a novel acetylation-phosphorylation switch at Lys-321/Ser-324 that coordinately regulates tau polymerization and function.",

In contrast, K254, K267, and K290 are part of the first and second repeats of the microtubule binding domain.

This HDAC6 inhibitory activity resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased Hsp90 and HDAC6 binding, causing ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau proteins. In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

Three of the sites (K163, K174, and K180) reside within the proline-rich region of the tau N-terminal projection domain, which mediates interactions with microtubule-associated proteins such as actin [27] and the Src homology three domain of plasma membrane-associated proteins including Src family kinases [37] and  phospholipase Cγ [54]. In contrast, K254, K267, and K290 are part of the first and second repeats of the microtubule binding domain. Although no Lys acetylation was detected at these sites in our datasets, it was possible to quantify relative methylation and ubiquitylation of K254.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

      "evidence": "Because S199/S202/T205E, S396/S404E, 6-Phos and 7-Phos all demonstrated an AD-like shift in mobility as a result of phosphorylation-like changes, we conclude that they have the characteristics of hyperphosphorylated tau. These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Our results indicated that MPT0G211 significantly reduced tau phosphorylation and aggregation, the processes highly correlated with the formation of NFTs. This HDAC6 inhibitory activity resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased Hsp90 and HDAC6 binding, causing ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau proteins. In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity.

This HDAC6 inhibitory activity resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased Hsp90 and HDAC6 binding, causing ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau proteins. In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

The effects of such treatment on a series of parameters useful in characterizing neuronal damage were investigated: (i) the basal release of glutamate, evaluated as (3)H-d-Aspartate efflux, was sharply, concentration-dependently, increased; (ii) the phosphorylation status of intracellular markers known to be involved in the neurodegenerative processes, in particular in Alzheimer disease: tau and GSK3β were increased, as well as the protein level of β-secretase (BACE1) and p35/25 evaluated by Western blotting, while (iii) the cell metabolic activity, measured with the MTT method, was reduced, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The latter effect, as well as tau hyperphosphorylation, was prevented both by a mixture of antioxidant drugs (100 μM ascorbic acid, 10 μM trolox, 100 μM glutathione) and by the anti-Alzheimer drug, memantine, 20 μM.",

Notably, TPI is the only glycolytic enzyme whose functional deficiency is associated to neurodegeneration (Eber et al., 1991; Ovadi et al., 2004). In particular, inefficient glycolysis (Hoyer et al., 1988) and ATP depletion (Keil et al., 2004) are characteristic in Alzheimer’s disease brains.",

Tau phosphorylation at an AD-related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1.",

Down-regulated miR-195 up-regulates p35, which provides the active substrates of p25",

We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo. The simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of hTau at lysines 163, 280, 281 and 369 drastically decreased hTau phosphorylation and significantly reduced its binding to microtubules in vivo. These molecular alterations were associated with ameliorated amyloid beta toxicity. Our results indicate acetylation of hTau on multiple sites regulates its biology and ameliorates amyloid beta toxicity in vivo.",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

The level of nitrated and hyperphosphorylated tau was markedly increased in rat hippocampus 24 h, and prevented by preinjection of uric acid, a natural scavenger of peroxynitrite. GSK-3beta and p38 MAPKs, including p38alpha, p38beta, and p38delta activity was increased, but no change in the activity of p38gamma, ERK, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). Both nitrated tau and hyperphosphorylated tau were aggregated in the hippocampus, with activity of 20S proteasome significantly arrested in SIN-1-injected rats. Hyperphosphorylated tau was degraded as efficiently as normal tau by 20S proteasome, but the nitrated tau with an unorderly secondary structure became more resistant to the proteolysis, providing evidence that peroxynitrite simultaneously induces tau hyperphosphorylation, nitration, and accumulation, and that activation of GSK-3beta, p38alpha, p38beta, p38delta isoforms and the inhibition of proteasome activity are respectively responsible for the peroxynitrite-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation.",

      "evidence": "The N-terminus of β-catenin has phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation sites that regulate its stability and signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are constitutively phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). β-Catenin phosphorylated at these sites is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which results in ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation. We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation. Lys49 acetylation results in decreased ubiquitination of β-catenin in the presence of proteasome inhibition. While increased Lys49 acetylation does not affect total levels of β-catenin, it results in increased membrane localization of β-catenin.",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

This molecule rescued the impaired long-term potentiation evident in hippocampal slices from APP/PS1 mice. Chronic treatment of Tg2576 mice with CM-414 diminished brain Aβ and tau phosphorylation (pTau) levels, increased the inactive form of GSK3β, reverted the decrease in dendritic spine density on hippocampal neurons, and reversed their cognitive deficits, at least in part by inducing the expression of genes related to synaptic transmission.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

TauF4 was phosphorylated by the proline-directed CDK2/CycA3 kinase on Thr231 (generating the AT180 epitope), Ser235, and equally on Thr212 and Thr217 in the Proline-rich region (Tau[Ser208-Gln244] or PRR). These modifications strongly decrease the capacity of TauF4 to polymerize tubulin into microtubules. While all the NMR parameters are consistent with a globally disordered Tau protein fragment, local clusters of structuration can be defined. The most salient result of our NMR analysis is that phosphorylation in the PRR stabilizes a short α-helix that runs from pSer235 till the very beginning of the microtubule-binding region (Tau[Thr245-Ser324] or MTBR of TauF4).",

TauF4 was phosphorylated by the proline-directed CDK2/CycA3 kinase on Thr231 (generating the AT180 epitope), Ser235, and equally on Thr212 and Thr217 in the Proline-rich region (Tau[Ser208-Gln244] or PRR). These modifications strongly decrease the capacity of TauF4 to polymerize tubulin into microtubules. While all the NMR parameters are consistent with a globally disordered Tau protein fragment, local clusters of structuration can be defined. The most salient result of our NMR analysis is that phosphorylation in the PRR stabilizes a short α-helix that runs from pSer235 till the very beginning of the microtubule-binding region (Tau[Thr245-Ser324] or MTBR of TauF4).",

We demonstrate that MARK2 interacts with tau and phosphorylates tau at Ser(262) in stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells expressing human recombinant tau. Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced the interaction between MARK2 and tau, and also phosphorylation of tau at Ser(262).",

The chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasomes in crude extracts was elevated after administration of db-cAMP or rolipram but was blocked by epoxomicin Exposure of slices from the early-stage mice to rolipram or db-cAMP for 8 h reduced amounts of total and insoluble tau (Fig. 3a), including phosphorylated tau (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). In contrast, epoxomicin treatment increased levels of phosphorylated tau (Supplementary Fig. 4), although the amount of total tau remained unchanged (Fig. 3a). PKA is known to phosphorylate tau at Ser214 (pS214)29. We therefore monitored the amount of pS214 tau to determine whether rolipram and db-cAMP activated PKA. The amount of pS214 tau was higher in db-cAMP– and rolipram-treated samples than in control (DMSO) and epoxomicin-treated slices (Fig. 3a).",

      "evidence": "Here we report abnormal acetylation of K274 and K281 on tau, identified in AD brains, promotes memory loss and disrupts synaptic plasticity by reducing postsynaptic KIdney/BRAin (KIBRA) protein, a memory-associated protein.Transgenic mice expressing human tau with lysine-to-glutamine mutations to mimic K274 and K281 acetylation (tauKQ) exhibit AD-related memory deficits and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). TauKQ reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion. The LTP deficit was rescued by promoting actin polymerization or by KIBRA expression. In AD patients with dementia, we found enhanced tau acetylation is linked to loss of KIBRA.",

Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown.

      "evidence": "Using transgenic Drosophila expressing human tau, we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of milton or Miro, an adaptor protein essential for axonal transport of mitochondria, enhanced human tau-induced neurodegeneration. Tau phosphorylation at an AD-related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1.",

      "evidence": "Our findings indicate that several acetylation sites in tau are responsive to HDAC6 and that acetylation on Lys-321 (within a KCGS motif) is both essential for acetylation-mediated inhibition of tau aggregation in vitro and a molecular tactic for preventing phosphorylation on the downstream Ser-324 residue. Tau phosphorylation of Ser-324 (pSer-324) has not previously been evaluated in the context of tauopathy, and here we observed increased deposition of pSer-324-positive tau both in mouse models of tauopathy and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings uncover a novel acetylation-phosphorylation switch at Lys-321/Ser-324 that coordinately regulates tau polymerization and function.",

The latter effect, as well as tau hyperphosphorylation, was prevented both by a mixture of antioxidant drugs (100 μM ascorbic acid, 10 μM trolox, 100 μM glutathione) and by the anti-Alzheimer drug, memantine, 20 μM.",

On the other hand, Cys-322 can be oxidized, and this leads to PHF assembly (ref. 11; this report). In vitro this is achieved most easily by using constructs of the 'fetal' isoform of T (htau23) that has only three repeats. Conversely, reducing agents or the second repeat or T can be viewed as 'antidotes' against PHF assembly.The synthetic PHFs bound the dye thioflavin S used in Alzheimer disease diagnostics.",

Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown.

Tau was shown to interact with each of the transfected MARK isoforms (Fig. 1) and to be phosphorylated at Ser262 (Fig. 2). Staurosporine, a non-selective kinase inhibitor, significantly inhibited interactions between tau and each of the four MARK isoforms after treatment with 20 lM staurosporine for 1 h (Fig. 1; p = 0.02 for MARK1–, MARK2– and MARK3–tau interactions and p = 3 9 10-6 for MARK4–tau interaction). Treatment with staurosporine also significantly reduced PLA signals for tau phosphorylation at Ser262 (Fig. 2; p = 0.04 for MARK1- and p = 0.02 for MARK2- and MARK3- and p = 1 9 10-5 for MARK4-mediated tau phosphorylation)",

We demonstrate that MARK2 interacts with tau and phosphorylates tau at Ser(262) in stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells expressing human recombinant tau.

      "evidence": "We show here that ITPKB protein level was increased 3-fold in the cerebral cortex of most patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with control subjects, and accumulated in dystrophic neurites associated to amyloid plaques. In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

Since DAPK1 is phosphorylated and inhibited by v-Src, these results highlight the importance of this kinase and the multiple mechanisms controlled by v-Src to antagonize the tumor suppressor function of DAPK1.",

We found GLP-1RA could promote mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system via regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) signaling pathway in vivo besides down-regulating the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) to reverse tau hyperphosphorylation directly.",

Tau phosphorylation of Ser-324 (pSer-324) has not previously been evaluated in the context of tauopathy, and here we observed increased deposition of pSer-324-positive tau both in mouse models of tauopathy and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings uncover a novel acetylation-phosphorylation switch at Lys-321/Ser-324 that coordinately regulates tau polymerization and function.",

      "evidence": "The N-terminus of β-catenin has phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation sites that regulate its stability and signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are constitutively phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). β-Catenin phosphorylated at these sites is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which results in ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation. We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation. Lys49 acetylation results in decreased ubiquitination of β-catenin in the presence of proteasome inhibition. While increased Lys49 acetylation does not affect total levels of β-catenin, it results in increased membrane localization of β-catenin.",

Tau phosphorylation at an AD-related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1.",

Lead compounds from the series have IC50 values toward CDK5/p25 and GSK3β in the low nanomolar range and no observed toxicity in the therapeutic dose range. Neuronal protective effects and decreased PHF-1 immunoreactivity were observed in two animal models, 3×Tg-AD and CK-p25. Treatment nearly eliminated Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau with the most prominent effect on the phosphorylation at Ser-404. Treatment also induced the recovery of memory in a fear conditioning assay.",

      "evidence": "The N-terminus of β-catenin has phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation sites that regulate its stability and signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are constitutively phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). β-Catenin phosphorylated at these sites is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which results in ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation. We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation. Lys49 acetylation results in decreased ubiquitination of β-catenin in the presence of proteasome inhibition. While increased Lys49 acetylation does not affect total levels of β-catenin, it results in increased membrane localization of β-catenin.",

Finally, PCAF is necessary for conditioning-dependent axonal regeneration and also singularly promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury. ",

We have used this compound as a chemical probe to validate this systems therapeutics strategy, where an increase in the activation of cAMP/cGMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) induced by PDE5 inhibition, combined with moderate HDAC class I inhibition, leads to efficient histone acetylation. This molecule rescued the impaired long-term potentiation evident in hippocampal slices from APP/PS1 mice. Chronic treatment of Tg2576 mice with CM-414 diminished brain Aβ and tau phosphorylation (pTau) levels, increased the inactive form of GSK3β, reverted the decrease in dendritic spine density on hippocampal neurons, and reversed their cognitive deficits, at least in part by inducing the expression of genes related to synaptic transmission.",

TauKQ reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion.

TauKQ reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion. The LTP deficit was rescued by promoting actin polymerization or by KIBRA expression. In AD patients with dementia, we found enhanced tau acetylation is linked to loss of KIBRA.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

In all experimental conditions, including tau-overexpressing cells, tau transgenic mice and AD brains, global levels of Pin1 posttranslational modifications were decreased compared with control conditions.",
