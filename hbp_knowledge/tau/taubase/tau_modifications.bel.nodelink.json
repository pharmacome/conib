The whole range of Tau species was immunoprecipitated (IP) from protein extracts with the Tau-5 antibody, which recognizes amino acid residues 218–225. As shown by WB analysis (Fig. S1), Tau-5 IP allows the purification of full-length Tau (FL-Tau) as well as N- and C-terminally truncated Tau and aggregated species, which display lower and higher molecular weights, respectively. These new N-terminal sites were scattered across the Tau sequence (Fig. 1D), and except for Ala2, have not been described before.",

PHF tau-directed antibodies AT8, MC-1 and PHF-1 co-localized with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine immunolabeling in AD NFT. Immunoaffinity purification and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PHF tau contains epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in parietal and frontal cortex in AD. In control cases with NFT present in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, indicative of Braak and Braak stage II, epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds were present in PHF tau in parietal and frontal cortex, despite the lack of microscopically detectable NFT or senile plaques in these cortical regions. The presence of PHF tau with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in brain regions devoid of NFT in stage II (but regions, which would be expected to contain NFT in stage III) suggests that these bonds occur early in the formation of NFT.",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

Our results indicated that MPT0G211 significantly reduced tau phosphorylation and aggregation, the processes highly correlated with the formation of NFTs. This HDAC6 inhibitory activity resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased Hsp90 and HDAC6 binding, causing ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau proteins. In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

FKBP12 also restored the oligomer of the peptide to its monomeric status. Mutational studies on the catalytic center of FKBP12 indicated that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP12 was essential for prevention of aggregation. Assuming that the propensity of aggregation of the peptide is different in each cis-/trans-isomer, we propose that the aggregation behavior of the R3 peptide can be theoretically described with a simple kinetic scheme, in which only the cis-isomer can aggregate and FKBP12 catalyzes isomerization of the peptide in both the monomeric and aggregative states.",

As shown by WB analysis (Fig. S1), Tau-5 IP allows the purification of full-length Tau (FL-Tau) as well as N- and C-terminally truncated Tau and aggregated species, which display lower and higher molecular weights, respectively. These new N-terminal sites were scattered across the Tau sequence (Fig. 1D), and except for Ala2, have not been described before.",

It resides within the “PHF6” motif of the MTBR, which has been reported to mediate the aggregation propensity of recombinant monomeric tau in vitro [6, 37]. Other methylation sites within the MTBR include K259, K290, and K353, each of which lies in a KXGS motif associated with AMP-activated protein kinase mediated regulation of microtubule binding [38]. Within the N-terminal projection domain, Lys methylation was detected at K24, K44, K67, and K190 (Fig. 1).",

Immunoaffinity purification and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PHF tau contains epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in parietal and frontal cortex in AD. In control cases with NFT present in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, indicative of Braak and Braak stage II, epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds were present in PHF tau in parietal and frontal cortex, despite the lack of microscopically detectable NFT or senile plaques in these cortical regions. The presence of PHF tau with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in brain regions devoid of NFT in stage II (but regions, which would be expected to contain NFT in stage III) suggests that these bonds occur early in the formation of NFT.",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads. Intriguingly, although Tau-nY29 stains both the neuronal and glial tau pathology of Pick disease, it detects only the neuronal pathology in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy without labeling the predominant glial pathology.",

An increased abundance of NO facilitated the S-nitrosylation (SNO) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). S-nitrosylated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) promoted the acetylation and activation of the acetyltransferase p300 and facilitated the nitrosylation and inactivation of the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The abundance of GAPDH-SNO was increased in postmortem brain samples from AD patients. Preventing the increase in GAPDH-SNO abundance in both cultured neurons and mice, either by overexpression of the nitrosylation mutant of GAPDH (GAPDH C150S) or by treatment with the GAPDH nitrosylation inhibitor CGP3466B (also known as omigapil), abrogated Aβ1-42-induced tau acetylation, memory impairment, and locomotor dysfunction in mice, suggesting that this drug might be repurposed to treat patients with AD.",

      "evidence": "It has been reported that the proteasomal machinery is modified by O-GlcNAcylation [53,126] and that after modification by OGT, the proteasome is inhibited [53]. Intriguingly, it has been proposed that a genetic impairment in the OGA gene results in proteasomal dysfunction through a lack of hydrolysis of the inhibitory O-GlcNAc residues of the 19S regulatory cap. Indeed, the OGA gene is located in the 10q locus [127,128], a chromosomal region frequently mutated in AD. The impairment of OGA in AD and the subsequent static OGlcNAcylation of the proteasome may explain why the latter fails to degrade neuronal aggregates. In addition, it has been reported that OGlcNAcylation reduces the sensitivity of intracellular proteins to proteasomal degradation by directly modifying them [43,129,130]. The two phenomena could thus act synergistically: a protein could escape degradation by means of its own O-GlcNAcylation and by the inhibitory effect of glycosylation on the proteasome, leading to a considerable decrease in the turnover of proteins that in turn may aggregate and cause neuronal death.",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

This observation suggests that nitration at Tyr29 is a disease-related event that may alter the intrinsic ability of tau to self-polymerize. In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads. Intriguingly, although Tau-nY29 stains both the neuronal and glial tau pathology of Pick disease, it detects only the neuronal pathology in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy without labeling the predominant glial pathology.",

      "evidence": "Filamentous, but not soluble, forms of wild-type tau inhibit anterograde, kinesin-based fast axonal transport (FAT) by activating axonal protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), independent of microtubule binding. Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

In contrast, larger aggregates of tau could bind heparin in the extracellular matrix and be internalized through macropinocytosis [170]. As a result of exocytosis and endocytosis, the spreading of tau can occur in various neurodegenerative diseases (tauopathies) including AD. Three plausible mechanisms of tau spreading are shown schematically in Figure 6. Additionally, it appears that microglial cells may facilitate tau propagation by phagocytosis and exocytosis of tau protein [171].",

In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

In contrast, K254, K267, and K290 are part of the first and second repeats of the microtubule binding domain. Although no Lys acetylation was detected at these sites in our datasets, it was possible to quantify relative methylation and ubiquitylation of K254.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Our results indicated that MPT0G211 significantly reduced tau phosphorylation and aggregation, the processes highly correlated with the formation of NFTs. This HDAC6 inhibitory activity resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased Hsp90 and HDAC6 binding, causing ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau proteins. In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

Since GSK-3β is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser9 by Ser/Thr protein kinases such as AKT, it has been suggested that NRF2 might be up-regulated through activation of AKT and permanent inactivation of GSK-3 [9], [10].",

In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

The effects of such treatment on a series of parameters useful in characterizing neuronal damage were investigated: (i) the basal release of glutamate, evaluated as (3)H-d-Aspartate efflux, was sharply, concentration-dependently, increased; (ii) the phosphorylation status of intracellular markers known to be involved in the neurodegenerative processes, in particular in Alzheimer disease: tau and GSK3β were increased, as well as the protein level of β-secretase (BACE1) and p35/25 evaluated by Western blotting, while (iii) the cell metabolic activity, measured with the MTT method, was reduced, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The latter effect, as well as tau hyperphosphorylation, was prevented both by a mixture of antioxidant drugs (100 μM ascorbic acid, 10 μM trolox, 100 μM glutathione) and by the anti-Alzheimer drug, memantine, 20 μM.",

Tau phosphorylation at an AD-related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1.",

We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo. The simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of hTau at lysines 163, 280, 281 and 369 drastically decreased hTau phosphorylation and significantly reduced its binding to microtubules in vivo. These molecular alterations were associated with ameliorated amyloid beta toxicity. Our results indicate acetylation of hTau on multiple sites regulates its biology and ameliorates amyloid beta toxicity in vivo.",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads. Intriguingly, although Tau-nY29 stains both the neuronal and glial tau pathology of Pick disease, it detects only the neuronal pathology in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy without labeling the predominant glial pathology.",

This observation suggests that nitration at Tyr29 is a disease-related event that may alter the intrinsic ability of tau to self-polymerize. In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads. Intriguingly, although Tau-nY29 stains both the neuronal and glial tau pathology of Pick disease, it detects only the neuronal pathology in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy without labeling the predominant glial pathology.",

Finally, PCAF is necessary for conditioning-dependent axonal regeneration and also singularly promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury. ",

Since GSK-3β is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser9 by Ser/Thr protein kinases such as AKT, it has been suggested that NRF2 might be up-regulated through activation of AKT and permanent inactivation of GSK-3 [9], [10].",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity.

These modifications strongly decrease the capacity of TauF4 to polymerize tubulin into microtubules. While all the NMR parameters are consistent with a globally disordered Tau protein fragment, local clusters of structuration can be defined. The most salient result of our NMR analysis is that phosphorylation in the PRR stabilizes a short α-helix that runs from pSer235 till the very beginning of the microtubule-binding region (Tau[Thr245-Ser324] or MTBR of TauF4).",

TauF4 was phosphorylated by the proline-directed CDK2/CycA3 kinase on Thr231 (generating the AT180 epitope), Ser235, and equally on Thr212 and Thr217 in the Proline-rich region (Tau[Ser208-Gln244] or PRR). These modifications strongly decrease the capacity of TauF4 to polymerize tubulin into microtubules. While all the NMR parameters are consistent with a globally disordered Tau protein fragment, local clusters of structuration can be defined. The most salient result of our NMR analysis is that phosphorylation in the PRR stabilizes a short α-helix that runs from pSer235 till the very beginning of the microtubule-binding region (Tau[Thr245-Ser324] or MTBR of TauF4).",

In this study, we took advantage of the in situ proximity ligation assay to investigate the role of MARK2, one of the four MARK isoforms, in AD. We demonstrate that MARK2 interacts with tau and phosphorylates tau at Ser(262) in stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells expressing human recombinant tau. Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced the interaction between MARK2 and tau, and also phosphorylation of tau at Ser(262).",

The chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasomes in crude extracts was elevated after administration of db-cAMP or rolipram but was blocked by epoxomicin Exposure of slices from the early-stage mice to rolipram or db-cAMP for 8 h reduced amounts of total and insoluble tau (Fig. 3a), including phosphorylated tau (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). In contrast, epoxomicin treatment increased levels of phosphorylated tau (Supplementary Fig. 4), although the amount of total tau remained unchanged (Fig. 3a). PKA is known to phosphorylate tau at Ser214 (pS214)29. We therefore monitored the amount of pS214 tau to determine whether rolipram and db-cAMP activated PKA. The amount of pS214 tau was higher in db-cAMP– and rolipram-treated samples than in control (DMSO) and epoxomicin-treated slices (Fig. 3a).",

Enhanced CDK5/p35 complex formation is strongly correlated with dissociation of F-actin from p35, suggesting the inhibitory mechanism of CDK5/p35 complex formation by F-actin.",

TauKQ reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion.

Phosphorylation of tau at the PHF-1 site was also reduced by MKI (Fig. 3A). It is possible that the PHF-1 site is also targeted by PAR-1/MARKs in vivo, or that the phosphorylation of tau at the 12E8 sites is a prerequisite for PHF-1 site phosphorylation, as the 12E8 sites were previously shown to be required for tau phosphorylation at other sites",

On the other hand, Cys-322 can be oxidized, and this leads to PHF assembly (ref. 11; this report). In vitro this is achieved most easily by using constructs of the 'fetal' isoform of T (htau23) that has only three repeats. Conversely, reducing agents or the second repeat or T can be viewed as 'antidotes' against PHF assembly.The synthetic PHFs bound the dye thioflavin S used in Alzheimer disease diagnostics.",

Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown.

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

Next we determined IC50 values for a subset of these kinase targets, using the same 33P incorporation assay (Table 1).",

We found GLP-1RA could promote mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system via regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) signaling pathway in vivo besides down-regulating the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) to reverse tau hyperphosphorylation directly.",

We found GLP-1RA could promote mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system via regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) signaling pathway in vivo besides down-regulating the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) to reverse tau hyperphosphorylation directly.",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides.

Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

We have used this compound as a chemical probe to validate this systems therapeutics strategy, where an increase in the activation of cAMP/cGMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) induced by PDE5 inhibition, combined with moderate HDAC class I inhibition, leads to efficient histone acetylation. This molecule rescued the impaired long-term potentiation evident in hippocampal slices from APP/PS1 mice. Chronic treatment of Tg2576 mice with CM-414 diminished brain Aβ and tau phosphorylation (pTau) levels, increased the inactive form of GSK3β, reverted the decrease in dendritic spine density on hippocampal neurons, and reversed their cognitive deficits, at least in part by inducing the expression of genes related to synaptic transmission.",

TauKQ reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion.

An increased abundance of NO facilitated the S-nitrosylation (SNO) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). S-nitrosylated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) promoted the acetylation and activation of the acetyltransferase p300 and facilitated the nitrosylation and inactivation of the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1).

S-guanylated tau inhibited heparin-induced tau aggregation (thioflavin T). S-guanylated tau could not form tau granules and fibrils (AFM) inhibited at the step of tau oligomer formation.

We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo.

Furthermore, we find that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated retrograde signalling is required for PCAF-dependent regenerative gene reprogramming. Finally, PCAF is necessary for conditioning-dependent axonal regeneration and also singularly promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury. ",

This HDAC6 inhibitory activity resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased Hsp90 and HDAC6 binding, causing ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau proteins. In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

Assuming that the propensity of aggregation of the peptide is different in each cis-/trans-isomer, we propose that the aggregation behavior of the R3 peptide can be theoretically described with a simple kinetic scheme, in which only the cis-isomer can aggregate and FKBP12 catalyzes isomerization of the peptide in both the monomeric and aggregative states.",
