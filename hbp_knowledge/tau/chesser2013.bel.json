The likelihood that in vivo tau can be ubiquitylated in multiple ways is supported by studies showing tau isolated from NFTs in human brain has several forms of ubiquitin linkages as well as mono-ubiquitylation (101, 102). These data suggest that the physical structure of the ubiquitin chain is unlikely to be a sufficient signal for selectively targeting tau to either the proteasome or autophagy.",
