The whole range of Tau species was immunoprecipitated (IP) from protein extracts with the Tau-5 antibody, which recognizes amino acid residues 218–225. As shown by WB analysis (Fig. S1), Tau-5 IP allows the purification of full-length Tau (FL-Tau) as well as N- and C-terminally truncated Tau and aggregated species, which display lower and higher molecular weights, respectively. These new N-terminal sites were scattered across the Tau sequence (Fig. 1D), and except for Ala2, have not been described before.",

In contrast, larger aggregates of tau could bind heparin in the extracellular matrix and be internalized through macropinocytosis [170]. As a result of exocytosis and endocytosis, the spreading of tau can occur in various neurodegenerative diseases (tauopathies) including AD. Three plausible mechanisms of tau spreading are shown schematically in Figure 6. Additionally, it appea rs that microglial cells may facilitate tau propagation by phagocytosis and exocytosis of tau protein [171].",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

Immunoaffinity purification and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PHF tau contains epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in parietal and frontal cortex in AD. In control cases with NFT present in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, indicative of Braak and Braak stage II, epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds were present in PHF tau in parietal and frontal cortex, despite the lack of microscopically detectable NFT or senile plaques in these cortical regions. The presence of PHF tau with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in brain regions devoid of NFT in stage II (but regions, which would be expected to contain NFT in stage III) suggests that these bonds occur early in the formation of NFT.",

As shown by WB analysis (Fig. S1), Tau-5 IP allows the purification of full-length Tau (FL-Tau) as well as N- and C-terminally truncated Tau and aggregated species, which display lower and higher molecular weights, respectively. These new N-terminal sites were scattered across the Tau sequence (Fig. 1D), and except for Ala2, have not been described before.",

Immunoaffinity purification and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PHF tau contains epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in parietal and frontal cortex in AD. In control cases with NFT present in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, indicative of Braak and Braak stage II, epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds were present in PHF tau in parietal and frontal cortex, despite the lack of microscopically detectable NFT or senile plaques in these cortical regions. The presence of PHF tau with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in brain regions devoid of NFT in stage II (but regions, which would be expected to contain NFT in stage III) suggests that these bonds occur early in the formation of NFT.",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads. Intriguingly, although Tau-nY29 stains both the neuronal and glial tau pathology of Pick disease, it detects only the neuronal pathology in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy without labeling the predominant glial pathology.",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

      "evidence": "The N-terminus of β-catenin has phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation sites that regulate its stability and signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are constitutively phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). β-Catenin phosphorylated at these sites is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which results in ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation. We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation. Lys49 acetylation results in decreased ubiquitination of β-catenin in the presence of proteasome inhibition. While increased Lys49 acetylation does not affect total levels of β-catenin, it results in increased membrane localization of β-catenin.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

These 4 markers are particularly useful in understanding potential posttraumatic events in CTE because PAD exposure impairs axonal transport (24), oligomers confer toxicity (28, 38–40), pS422 correlates with cognitive decline (15), and D421 truncated tau may be related to cell toxicity (41, 42).

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

Amino acids 2-18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT",

FKBP12 also restored the oligomer of the peptide to its monomeric status. Mutational studies on the catalytic center of FKBP12 indicated that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP12 was essential for prevention of aggregation. Assuming that the propensity of aggregation of the peptide is different in each cis-/trans-isomer, we propose that the aggregation behavior of the R3 peptide can be theoretically described with a simple kinetic scheme, in which only the cis-isomer can aggregate and FKBP12 catalyzes isomerization of the peptide in both the monomeric and aggregative states.",

In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads. Intriguingly, although Tau-nY29 stains both the neuronal and glial tau pathology of Pick disease, it detects only the neuronal pathology in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy without labeling the predominant glial pathology.",

The level of nitrated and hyperphosphorylated tau was markedly increased in rat hippocampus 24 h, and prevented by preinjection of uric acid, a natural scavenger of peroxynitrite. GSK-3beta and p38 MAPKs, including p38alpha, p38beta, and p38delta activity was increased, but no change in the activity of p38gamma, ERK, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). Both nitrated tau and hyperphosphorylated tau were aggregated in the hippocampus, with activity of 20S proteasome significantly arrested in SIN-1-injected rats. Hyperphosphorylated tau was degraded as efficiently as normal tau by 20S proteasome, but the nitrated tau with an unorderly secondary structure became more resistant to the proteolysis, providing evidence that peroxynitrite simultaneously induces tau hyperphosphorylation, nitration, and accumulation, and that activation of GSK-3beta, p38alpha, p38beta, p38delta isoforms and the inhibition of proteasome activity are respectively responsible for the peroxynitrite-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

These results demonstrate that CaMKv regulates spine maintenance through RhoA inhibition. The suppression of the Lfc/RhoA pathway by AMPA receptors is implicated in dendritic spine maintenance10. Given that CaMKv expression is upregulated by synaptic activity, CaMKv may be a key signalling protein that transduces the signals from AMPA receptors to suppress RhoA during activity-dependent spine maintenance. Corroborating this, the AMPA receptor blocker NBQX attenuated CaMKv expression in neurons (Fig. 3i,j). Importantly, CaMKv overexpression completely rescued NBQX-induced spine loss (Fig. 3k,l). These findings collectively reveal that activity-dependent CaMKv expression and the subsequent inhibition of Lfc/RhoA are required to mediate AMPA receptor function in spine maintenance.",

In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

In contrast, larger aggregates of tau could bind heparin in the extracellular matrix and be internalized through macropinocytosis [170]. As a result of exocytosis and endocytosis, the spreading of tau can occur in various neurodegenerative diseases (tauopathies) including AD. Three plausible mechanisms of tau spreading are shown schematically in Figure 6. Additionally, it appea rs that microglial cells may facilitate tau propagation by phagocytosis and exocytosis of tau protein [171].",

Tau phosphorylation of Ser-324 (pSer-324) has not previously been evaluated in the context of tauopathy, and here we observed increased deposition of pSer-324-positive tau both in mouse models of tauopathy and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings uncover a novel acetylation-phosphorylation switch at Lys-321/Ser-324 that coordinately regulates tau polymerization and function.",

Tau phosphorylation at an AD-related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1.",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo. The simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of hTau at lysines 163, 280, 281 and 369 drastically decreased hTau phosphorylation and significantly reduced its binding to microtubules in vivo. These molecular alterations were associated with ameliorated amyloid beta toxicity. Our results indicate acetylation of hTau on multiple sites regulates its biology and ameliorates amyloid beta toxicity in vivo.",

This observation suggests that nitration at Tyr29 is a disease-related event that may alter the intrinsic ability of tau to self-polymerize. In Alzheimer's brain, Tau-nY29 labels the fibrillar triad of tau lesions, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and, to a lesser extent, neuropil threads. Intriguingly, although Tau-nY29 stains both the neuronal and glial tau pathology of Pick disease, it detects only the neuronal pathology in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy without labeling the predominant glial pathology.",

In addition the levels of tissue transglutaminase, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, were elevated approximately 3-fold in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex compared to control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that transglutaminase is increased in Alzheimer's disease brain. There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases. Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant, and not in the cerebellum, which is usually spared in Alzheimer's disease, it can be suggested that transglutaminase could be a contributing factor in neurofibrillary tangle formation.",

Furthermore, we find that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated retrograde signalling is required for PCAF-dependent regenerative gene reprogramming. Finally, PCAF is necessary for conditioning-dependent axonal regeneration and also singularly promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury. ",

These results demonstrate that CaMKv regulates spine maintenance through RhoA inhibition. The suppression of the Lfc/RhoA pathway by AMPA receptors is implicated in dendritic spine maintenance10. Given that CaMKv expression is upregulated by synaptic activity, CaMKv may be a key signalling protein that transduces the signals from AMPA receptors to suppress RhoA during activity-dependent spine maintenance. Corroborating this, the AMPA receptor blocker NBQX attenuated CaMKv expression in neurons (Fig. 3i,j). Importantly, CaMKv overexpression completely rescued NBQX-induced spine loss (Fig. 3k,l). These findings collectively reveal that activity-dependent CaMKv expression and the subsequent inhibition of Lfc/RhoA are required to mediate AMPA receptor function in spine maintenance.",

These results demonstrate that CaMKv regulates spine maintenance through RhoA inhibition. The suppression of the Lfc/RhoA pathway by AMPA receptors is implicated in dendritic spine maintenance10. Given that CaMKv expression is upregulated by synaptic activity, CaMKv may be a key signalling protein that transduces the signals from AMPA receptors to suppress RhoA during activity-dependent spine maintenance.

In parallel, the phosphatases DUSP6 and PPP1CA and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-W are downregulated as direct targets of miR-125b. Knockdown of these phosphatases induces tau hyperphosphorylation, and overexpression of PPP1CA and Bcl-W prevents miR-125b-induced tau phosphorylation, suggesting that they mediate the effects of miR-125b on tau. Conversely, suppression of miR-125b in neurons by tough decoys reduces tau phosphorylation and kinase expression/activity. Injecting miR-125b into the hippocampus of mice impairs associative learning and is accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-W, DUSP6, and PPP1CA, resulting in increased tau phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, DUSP6 and PPP1CA are also reduced in AD brains.",

Our results indicated the increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 and level of GST, suggesting the increased activity of the transcription factor as a result of GSK-3β suppression, consistent with the decreased oxidative stress observed. Consistent with the improved learning and memory, and consistent with GSK-3b being a tau kinase, we observed decreased tau phosphorylation in brain of GAO-treated SAMP8 mice compared to that of RAO-treated SAMP8 mice.",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

We have used this compound as a chemical probe to validate this systems therapeutics strategy, where an increase in the activation of cAMP/cGMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) induced by PDE5 inhibition, combined with moderate HDAC class I inhibition, leads to efficient histone acetylation. This molecule rescued the impaired long-term potentiation evident in hippocampal slices from APP/PS1 mice. Chronic treatment of Tg2576 mice with CM-414 diminished brain Aβ and tau phosphorylation (pTau) levels, increased the inactive form of GSK3β, reverted the decrease in dendritic spine density on hippocampal neurons, and reversed their cognitive deficits, at least in part by inducing the expression of genes related to synaptic transmission.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.",

TauF4 was phosphorylated by the proline-directed CDK2/CycA3 kinase on Thr231 (generating the AT180 epitope), Ser235, and equally on Thr212 and Thr217 in the Proline-rich region (Tau[Ser208-Gln244] or PRR). These modifications strongly decrease the capacity of TauF4 to polymerize tubulin into microtubules. While all the NMR parameters are consistent with a globally disordered Tau protein fragment, local clusters of structuration can be defined. The most salient result of our NMR analysis is that phosphorylation in the PRR stabilizes a short α-helix that runs from pSer235 till the very beginning of the microtubule-binding region (Tau[Thr245-Ser324] or MTBR of TauF4).",

      "evidence": "In this study, we address the structural impact of phosphorylation of the Tau protein by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on a functional fragment of Tau (Tau[Ser208-Ser324] = TauF4). TauF4 was phosphorylated by the proline-directed CDK2/CycA3 kinase on Thr231 (generating the AT180 epitope), Ser235, and equally on Thr212 and Thr217 in the Proline-rich region (Tau[Ser208-Gln244] or PRR). These modifications strongly decrease the capacity of TauF4 to polymerize tubulin into microtubules. While all the NMR parameters are consistent with a globally disordered Tau protein fragment, local clusters of structuration can be defined. The most salient result of our NMR analysis is that phosphorylation in the PRR stabilizes a short α-helix that runs from pSer235 till the very beginning of the microtubule-binding region (Tau[Thr245-Ser324] or MTBR of TauF4).",

In this study, we took advantage of the in situ proximity ligation assay to investigate the role of MARK2, one of the four MARK isoforms, in AD. We demonstrate that MARK2 interacts with tau and phosphorylates tau at Ser(262) in stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells expressing human recombinant tau. Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced the interaction between MARK2 and tau, and also phosphorylation of tau at Ser(262).",

Tau was shown to interact with each of the transfected MARK isoforms (Fig. 1) and to be phosphorylated at Ser262 (Fig. 2). Staurosporine, a non-selective kinase inhibitor, significantly inhibited interactions between tau and each of the four MARK isoforms after treatment with 20 lM staurosporine for 1 h (Fig. 1; p = 0.02 for MARK1–, MARK2– and MARK3–tau interactions and p = 3 9 10-6 for MARK4–tau interaction). Treatment with staurosporine also significantly reduced PLA signals for tau phosphorylation at Ser262 (Fig. 2; p = 0.04 for MARK1- and p = 0.02 for MARK2- and MARK3- and p = 1 9 10-5 for MARK4-mediated tau phosphorylation)",

These residues are also phosphorylated in vivo, and the phosphorylation of Thr84 within Cluster-2 is essential for triggering binding to the C2B domain of human synaptotagmin-1",

      "evidence": "Using transgenic Drosophila expressing human tau, we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of milton or Miro, an adaptor protein essential for axonal transport of mitochondria, enhanced human tau-induced neurodegeneration. Tau phosphorylation at an AD-related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1.",

In the absence of a Wnt signal, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are constitutively phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). β-Catenin phosphorylated at these sites is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which results in ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation. We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation. Lys49 acetylation results in decreased ubiquitination of β-catenin in the presence of proteasome inhibition. While increased Lys49 acetylation does not affect total levels of β-catenin, it results in increased membrane localization of β-catenin.",

On the other hand, Cys-322 can be oxidized, and this leads to PHF assembly (ref. 11; this report). In vitro this is achieved most easily by using constructs of the 'fetal' isoform of T (htau23) that has only three repeats. Conversely, reducing agents or the second repeat or T can be viewed as 'antidotes' against PHF assembly.The synthetic PHFs bound the dye thioflavin S used in Alzheimer disease diagnostics.",

These results strongly suggest a role of endogenous DAPK in stimulating the activity of endogenous MARK, which in turn phosphorylates tau in neurons.",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

TauKQ reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion. The LTP deficit was rescued by promoting actin polymerization or by KIBRA expression. In AD patients with dementia, we found enhanced tau acetylation is linked to loss of KIBRA.",

In mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, Itpkb overexpression was associated with increased cell apoptosis and increased β-secretase 1 activity leading to overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. In this cellular model, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinases 1/2 completely prevented overproduction of amyloid-β peptides. Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation. However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity, resulting in exacerbated Alzheimer's disease pathology as shown by increased astrogliosis, amyloid-β40 peptide production and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

Tau phosphorylation of Ser-324 (pSer-324) has not previously been evaluated in the context of tauopathy, and here we observed increased deposition of pSer-324-positive tau both in mouse models of tauopathy and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings uncover a novel acetylation-phosphorylation switch at Lys-321/Ser-324 that coordinately regulates tau polymerization and function.",

      "evidence": "Overexpression of MARK4 led to tau hyperphosphorylation, reduced expression of synaptic markers, and loss of dendritic spines and synapses, phenotypes also observed after Aβ treatment. Importantly, expression of a non-phosphorylatable form of tau with the PAR-1/MARK site mutated blocked the synaptic toxicity induced by MARK4 overexpression or Aβ treatment. To probe the involvement of endogenous MARK kinases in mediating the synaptic toxicity of Aβ, we employed a peptide inhibitor capable of effectively and specifically inhibiting the activities of all PAR-1/MARK family members. This inhibitor abrogated the toxic effects of Aβ oligomers on dendritic spines and synapses as assayed at the morphological and electrophysiological levels.",

The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation. We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation. Lys49 acetylation results in decreased ubiquitination of β-catenin in the presence of proteasome inhibition. While increased Lys49 acetylation does not affect total levels of β-catenin, it results in increased membrane localization of β-catenin.",

      "evidence": "The N-terminus of β-catenin has phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation sites that regulate its stability and signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are constitutively phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). β-Catenin phosphorylated at these sites is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which results in ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation. We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation.

We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo. The simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of hTau at lysines 163, 280, 281 and 369 drastically decreased hTau phosphorylation and significantly reduced its binding to microtubules in vivo. These molecular alterations were associated with ameliorated amyloid beta toxicity. Our results indicate acetylation of hTau on multiple sites regulates its biology and ameliorates amyloid beta toxicity in vivo.",

Tau phosphorylation of Ser-324 (pSer-324) has not previously been evaluated in the context of tauopathy, and here we observed increased deposition of pSer-324-positive tau both in mouse models of tauopathy and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings uncover a novel acetylation-phosphorylation switch at Lys-321/Ser-324 that coordinately regulates tau polymerization and function.",

      "evidence": "Our findings indicate that several acetylation sites in tau are responsive to HDAC6 and that acetylation on Lys-321 (within a KCGS motif) is both essential for acetylation-mediated inhibition of tau aggregation in vitro and a molecular tactic for preventing phosphorylation on the downstream Ser-324 residue. Tau phosphorylation of Ser-324 (pSer-324) has not previously been evaluated in the context of tauopathy, and here we observed increased deposition of pSer-324-positive tau both in mouse models of tauopathy and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings uncover a novel acetylation-phosphorylation switch at Lys-321/Ser-324 that coordinately regulates tau polymerization and function.",

In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment.",

In parallel, the phosphatases DUSP6 and PPP1CA and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-W are downregulated as direct targets of miR-125b. Knockdown of these phosphatases induces tau hyperphosphorylation, and overexpression of PPP1CA and Bcl-W prevents miR-125b-induced tau phosphorylation, suggesting that they mediate the effects of miR-125b on tau. Conversely, suppression of miR-125b in neurons by tough decoys reduces tau phosphorylation and kinase expression/activity. Injecting miR-125b into the hippocampus of mice impairs associative learning and is accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-W, DUSP6, and PPP1CA, resulting in increased tau phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, DUSP6 and PPP1CA are also reduced in AD brains.",

FKBP12 also restored the oligomer of the peptide to its monomeric status. Mutational studies on the catalytic center of FKBP12 indicated that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP12 was essential for prevention of aggregation. Assuming that the propensity of aggregation of the peptide is different in each cis-/trans-isomer, we propose that the aggregation behavior of the R3 peptide can be theoretically described with a simple kinetic scheme, in which only the cis-isomer can aggregate and FKBP12 catalyzes isomerization of the peptide in both the monomeric and aggregative states.",
