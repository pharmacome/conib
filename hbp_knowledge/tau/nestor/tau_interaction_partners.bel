association with microtubules. It is found in the axonal microtubules of mature neurons (Binder et al ., 1985) and in the axonlike elongated neurite \
processes synthesized by differentiating neurons in culture. To address this issue, three different tau protein fragments were synthesized \
in vitro: (a) the tau protein repeat domain (residues 237 to 367); (b) the amino terminal half of tau protein (residues 1-237) ; and (c) the carboxy terminal nonrepeat domain \
of tau protein (residues 358 to 430). From these results, we conclude the repeat domain contributes most of the binding energy for microtubules."

but the extent of myelination rostral and caudal to the injection site was decreased compared to control. Cultured experimental cells display shorter cellular process length.

However, unlike hsc70, which does not associate directly with tubulin or microtubules (Gache et al. 2005), hsp70 binds microtubules,
presumably through its N-terminus (Sanchez et al. 1994). This would allow hsp70 to simultaneously bind to tau through its C-terminal substrate-binding domain and

the receptor for advanced glycation ending products, and subsequently activate nuclear AP-1/cJun transcription, in cultured human neural stem cells.
In addition, as revealed by Western blot, small interfering RNA and immunofluorescence analysis, S100B-induced JNK activation increased expression
of Dickopff-1 that, in turn, promoted glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² phosphorylation and Î²-catenin degradation, causing canonical Wnt pathway
disruption and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. These findings propose a previously unrecognized link between S100B and tau hyperphosphorylation,
suggesting S100B can contribute to NFT formation in AD and in all other conditions in which neuroinflammation may have a crucial role."

Indeed, FLAG-tau co-immunoprecipitated with HA-GSK3Beta from cells overexpressing FLAG-tau and HA-GSK3Beta only when these cells also overexpressed Xpress-14-3-3zeta
(Fig. 6A, lanes 8 and 9), indicating that GSK3Beta associates with tau only in the presence of 14-3-3zeta.
As discussed above, 14-3-3zeta binds to tau (36) and GSK3Beta (Fig. 5) directly. Taken together, these observations indicated that 14-3-3zeta connects GSK3Beta to tau in vivo."

which is required for fynâs localization in DRMs. This treatment resulted in a progressive reduction in both fyn and tau in DRMs, demonstrating

under conditions where assembly is driven by high ionic strength and high protein concentration [5,26]. This would suggest that some non-repeat domains of tau prevent PHF formation.
The same tendency is observed here again, but low we find that the inhibition can be easily overcome by RNA in most cases. Since dimers are
building blocks of PHFs, the extra repeat (no. 2) effectively acted as a PHF inhibitor [22]. However, this inhibition can be overcome by tRNA."
