9-11 cases with CTE and cases of nondemented aged controls and AD (Braak VI) (n = 6, each).
These 4 markers are particularly useful in understanding potential posttraumatic events in CTE because PAD exposure impairs axonal transport (24),
oligomers confer toxicity (28, 38–40), pS422 correlates with cognitive decline (15), and D421 truncated tau may be related to cell toxicity (41, 42).
All 3 early tau markers (ie, TNT1, TOC1, and pS422) were present in CTE and displayed
extensive colocalization in perivascular tau lesions that are considered diagnostic for CTE."

There were no significant differences in transglutaminase activity or levels in the cerebellum between control and Alzheimer's disease cases.
Because the elevation of transglutaminase in the Alzheimer's disease samples occurred in the prefrontal cortex, where neurofibrillary pathology is usually abundant,

The level of nitrated and hyperphosphorylated tau was markedly increased in rat hippocampus 24 h, and prevented by preinjection of uric acid, a natural scavenger of
peroxynitrite. GSK-3beta and p38 MAPKs, including p38alpha, p38beta, and p38delta activity was increased, but no change in the activity of p38gamma, ERK, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK).
Both nitrated tau and hyperphosphorylated tau were aggregated in the hippocampus, with activity of 20S proteasome significantly arrested in SIN-1-injected rats.
Hyperphosphorylated tau was degraded as efficiently as normal tau by 20S proteasome, but the nitrated tau with an unorderly secondary structure became more resistant to the proteolysis,
providing evidence that peroxynitrite simultaneously induces tau hyperphosphorylation, nitration, and accumulation, and that activation of GSK-3beta, p38alpha, p38beta, p38delta isoforms

The suppression of the Lfc/RhoA pathway by AMPA receptors is implicated in dendritic spine maintenance10. Given that CaMKv expression is upregulated by synaptic activity,
CaMKv may be a key signalling protein that transduces the signals from AMPA receptors to suppress RhoA during activity-dependent spine maintenance.
Corroborating this, the AMPA receptor blocker NBQX attenuated CaMKv expression in neurons (Fig. 3i,j).
Importantly, CaMKv overexpression completely rescued NBQX-induced spine loss (Fig. 3k,l).
These findings collectively reveal that activity-dependent CaMKv expression and the subsequent inhibition of Lfc/RhoA are required to mediate AMPA receptor function in spine maintenance."

TauF4 was phosphorylated by the proline-directed CDK2/CycA3 kinase on Thr231 (generating the AT180 epitope), Ser235, and equally on Thr212 and Thr217 in the Proline-rich region (Tau[Ser208-Gln244] or PRR).
These modifications strongly decrease the capacity of TauF4 to polymerize tubulin into microtubules. While all the NMR parameters are consistent with a globally disordered Tau protein fragment, local clusters of structuration can be defined.
The most salient result of our NMR analysis is that phosphorylation in the PRR stabilizes a short α-helix that runs from pSer235 till the very beginning of the microtubule-binding region (Tau[Thr245-Ser324] or MTBR of TauF4)."

Transgenic overexpression of ITPKB in mouse forebrain neurons was not sufficient to induce amyloid plaque formation or tau hyperphosphorylation.
However, in the 5X familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model, neuronal ITPKB overexpression significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation and β-secretase 1 activity,

In the absence of a Wnt signal, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 are constitutively phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β).
β-Catenin phosphorylated at these sites is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which results in ubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
The N-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin also includes Ser45, a phosphorylation site for Casein Kinase 1α (CK1α) and Lys49, which is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF).
The relevance of Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation to the function of β-catenin is an active area of investigation.
We find that HDAC6 inhibitors increase Lys49 acetylation and Ser45 phosphorylation but do not affect Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 phosphorylation.
Lys49 acetylation results in decreased ubiquitination of β-catenin in the presence of proteasome inhibition.
While increased Lys49 acetylation does not affect total levels of β-catenin, it results in increased membrane localization of β-catenin."

thus avoiding potential toxicity due to genetic over-expression. hTau knock-in (KI) proteins were expressed at normal, endogenous levels, bound to fly microtubules and were post-translationally modified, hence displaying physiological properties.
We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo. The simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of hTau at lysines 163, 280, 281 and 369 drastically decreased hTau phosphorylation and significantly reduced its binding to microtubules in vivo.
These molecular alterations were associated with ameliorated amyloid beta toxicity. Our results indicate acetylation of hTau on multiple sites regulates its biology and ameliorates amyloid beta toxicity in vivo."

dysfunction through a lack of hydrolysis of the inhibitory O-GlcNAc residues of the 19S regulatory cap. Indeed, the OGA gene is located in the 10q locus [127,128], a chromosomal region frequently mutated in
AD. The impairment of OGA in AD and the subsequent static OGlcNAcylation of the proteasome may explain why the latter fails to degrade neuronal aggregates.
In addition, it has been reported that OGlcNAcylation reduces the sensitivity of intracellular proteins to
proteasomal degradation by directly modifying them [43,129,130]. The two phenomena could thus act synergistically: a protein could
escape degradation by means of its own O-GlcNAcylation and by the inhibitory effect of glycosylation on the proteasome, leading to a
considerable decrease in the turnover of proteins that in turn may aggregate and cause neuronal death."

In parallel, the phosphatases DUSP6 and PPP1CA and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-W are downregulated as direct targets of miR-125b.
Knockdown of these phosphatases induces tau hyperphosphorylation, and overexpression of PPP1CA and Bcl-W prevents miR-125b-induced tau phosphorylation, suggesting that they mediate the effects of miR-125b on tau.
Conversely, suppression of miR-125b in neurons by tough decoys reduces tau phosphorylation and kinase expression/activity. Injecting miR-125b into the hippocampus of mice impairs associative learning and is accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-W, DUSP6, and PPP1CA, resulting in increased tau phosphorylation in vivo.

FKBP12 also restored the oligomer of the peptide to its monomeric status. Mutational studies on the catalytic center of FKBP12 indicated that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP12 was essential for prevention of aggregation.
