SET Evidence = "Acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), like many other
ligand-activated neurotransmitter receptors, consist of
two major subtypes: the metabotropic muscarinic receptors
and the ionotropic nicotinic receptors. Both share the
property of being activated by the endogenous neurotransmitter
acetylcholine (ACh), and they are expressed
by both neuronal and nonneuronal cells throughout the
body (8, 113, 142, 184)."

SET Evidence = "The metabotropic receptors are
second messenger, G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane
proteins. They are classically defined as being activated
by muscarine, a toxin from the mushroom Amanita
muscaria, and inhibited by atropine, a toxin from
Atropa belladonna, a member of the nightshade family.
Both toxins cross the blood-brain barrier poorly and were
discovered primarily from their influences on postganglionic
parasympathetic nervous system functions. Activation
of muscarinic AChRs is relatively slow (milliseconds
to seconds) and, depending on the subtypes present (M1-
M5), they directly alter cellular homeostasis of phospholipase
C, inositol trisphosphate, cAMP, and free calcium."

As a result, quite distinctly from other nAChRs and even

mechanisms, including activation of second messenger
pathways (328, 456)."

tobacco plant without ill effects. Manduca exhibits two
adaptations to tolerate the effects of nicotine. The first is
altered nAChR amino acid sequences that limit the affinity
of nicotine for the nAChR (136). The second is the development
of the functional equivalent to a blood-brain barrier."

Ref. 286), which preferentially binds to and inactivates
neuronal nAChRs that contain the alpha3 and beta4 subunits. In
this case, the specificity of the toxin appears to in part be
controlled by the subtype of beta nAChR subunit; beta2-containing

toxin is a product of the blue-green algae, Anabaena, and
can reach high concentrations during algal blooms common
to ponds that serve as the summer water source of
livestock. While this toxin exerts much of its effect
through targeting muscle nAChRs, it was recognized over
two decades ago to also interact with nAChRs expressed
by ganglionic receptors (38). Its ability to activate in
central nervous system (CNS) neurons nicotinic currents
sensitive to alpha-BGT was among the first indicators that
functional alpha7 nAChRs could be distinguished from other
nAChRs in neurons of the mammalian brain (38)."

another example of how a nicotinic agonist can

potent analgesic, when injected into mice at a relatively
low dose (0.4 microg/mouse), this compound produced straub

Delphinium), which is of great economic interest since
estimates of its cost to ranchers in poisoned livestock
exceeds many millions of dollars annually. Similar to

site (Fig. 3) in a manner similar to that of alpha-BGT
