However, a case with an unusually large STK11 deletion has been described in which Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, mental retardation, and schizophrenia co-occurred [33]. Similarly, a genome-wide screen in siblings co-affected by  schizophrenia found reduced copy numbers of STK11 in 3/18 individuals, significantly more often than in controls [34].Finally, STK11, also known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1), is a necessary intermediate in APP overexpression-induced tau phosphorylation",

However, a case with an unusually large STK11 deletion has been described in which Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, mental retardation, and schizophrenia co-occurred [33]. Similarly, a genome-wide screen in siblings co-affected by  schizophrenia found reduced copy numbers of STK11 in 3/18 individuals, significantly more often than in controls [34].Finally, STK11, also known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1), is a necessary intermediate in APP overexpression-induced tau phosphorylation",

However, a case with an unusually large STK11 deletion has been described in which Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, mental retardation, and schizophrenia co-occurred [33]. Similarly, a genome-wide screen in siblings co-affected by  schizophrenia found reduced copy numbers of STK11 in 3/18 individuals, significantly more often than in controls [34].Finally, STK11, also known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1), is a necessary intermediate in APP overexpression-induced tau phosphorylation",
