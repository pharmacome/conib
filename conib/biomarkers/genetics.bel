SET Evidence = "The literature on GWAS (genome-wide association studies) data suggests\
that very large sample sizes (for example, 50,000 cases and 50,000 controls) may be required\
to detect significant associations of genomic regions for complex disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).\
Because of the challenges of obtaining such large cohorts, we describe here a novel sequential strategy\
that combines pooling of DNA and bootstrapping (pbGWAS) in order to significantly increase the statistical\
power and exponentially reduce expenses. We applied this method to a very homogeneous sample of patients\
belonging to a unique and clinically well-characterized multigenerational pedigree with one of the most\
severe forms of early onset AD, carrying the PSEN1 p.Glu280Ala mutation (often referred to as E280A mutation),\
which originated as a consequence of a founder effect. In this cohort, we identified novel loci genome-wide\
significantly associated as modifiers of the age of onset of AD (CD44, rs187116, P=1.29 x 10(-12);\
NPHP1, rs10173717, P=1.74 — 10(-12); CADPS2, rs3757536, P=1.54 x 10(-10); GREM2, rs12129547, P=1.69 x 10(-13),\

SET Evidence ="The ApoE gene responsible for the Alzheimer's disease has been examined\
to identify functional consequences of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\
Eighty-eight SNPs have been identified in the ApoE gene in which 31 are found to be nonsynonymous,\
8 of them are coding synonymous, 33 are found to be in intron, and 3 are in untranslated region.\
The SNPs found in the untranslated region consisted of two SNPs from 5' and one SNP from the 3'.\
Twenty-nine percent of the identified nsSNPs have been reported as damaging. In the analysis of SNPs\
in the UTR regions, it has been recognized that rs72654467 from 5' and rs71673244 from 5' and 3' are\
responsible for the alteration in levels of expression. Both native and mutant protein structures were\
analyzed along with the stabilization residues. It has been concluded that among all SNPs of ApoE, the\
mutation in rs11542041 (R132S) has the most significant effect on functional variation."

In contrast, in AD brain, NGFR acts as a proapoptotic receptor in neuron cell death via binding to amyloid-beta (Abeta), NGF, or proNGF [9,10]. As a whole, NGFR plays multiple roles (survival and apoptotic process) in human brain, dependent on the cellular context."

Experimentally, we demonstrated that knockdown of RAB10 resulted in a significant decrease in Abeta42 (p value = 0.0003) and in the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio (p value = 0.0001) in neuroblastoma cells. We also found that RAB10 expression is significantly elevated in human AD brains (p value = 0.04)."

SET Evidence = "The oxidized LDL receptor 1 gene (OLR1) rs1050283 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been previously shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An association analysis of OLR1 was carried out in a population of 443 patients with AD as compared with 393 age-matched controls. In addition, an expression analysis of OLR1 and its regulatory hsa-miR369-3p was performed in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) from 20 patients and 15 controls. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for gender and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status, showed a statistically significant association of OLR1 rs1050283 under the assumption of a dominant model (CC and CT individuals versus TT: p = 0.014, OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.08-2.08) and a genotypic model (TC versus TT: p = 0.002, OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.14-2.26). No significant differences in OLR1 expression was observed between patients and controls (p > 0.05). However, stratifying patients according to the rs1050283 status, significantly decreased relative PBMC expression levels of OLR1 were observed in carriers of CC+CT genotypes as compared with TT carriers (0.13 ÃƒbetaÃ‚Â± 0.013 versus 0.46 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 0.028, p = 0.022), whereas no differences in relative expression levels of the hsa-miR369-3p were observed (p > 0.05). The effect observed was not due to the presence of the ApoE ε4 allele. The OLR1 rs1050283 SNP likely acts as a risk factor for sporadic AD. The presence of at least one C allele is associated with a decreased expression of OLR1 mRNA in the absence of hsa-miR369-3p de-regulation, suggesting that the presence of the polymorphic allele influences the binding of hsa-miR369-3p to its 3'UTR consensus sequence. Nevertheless, the limited power of the study requires further investigations with a larger sample size."

To explore this hypothesis, we carried out a meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising 1, 256 SNPs in the NRXN1, NRXN2, NRXN3, and NLGN1 genes (3,009 cases and 3,006 control individuals).

SET Evidence = "Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia, the brain's resident phagocyte, are pivotal for the immune response observed in AD. Microglia act as sentinel and protective cells, but may become inappropriately reactive in AD to drive neuropathology. Recent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 gene variants associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD (LOAD), the most prevalent form of AD [1]. The findings strongly implicate genes related to the immune response (CR1, CD33, MS4A1, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1), endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM, CD2AP, EPHA1 and SORL1) and lipid biology (CLU, ABCA7 and SORL1) [2-8], and many encode proteins which are highly expressed in microglia [1]. Furthermore, recent identification of a low frequency mutation in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2) confers increased risk of AD in LOAD cohorts with an effect size similar to that for APOE, until recently the only identified genetic risk factor associated with LOAD [9,10(Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢)] (Figure 1). The present review summarises our current understanding of the probable roles of microglial genes in the regulation of neuroinflammatory processes in AD and their relation to other processes affecting the disease's progression."

Indeed, cdk5 has to be associated with its regulatory subunit, p35 to be activated. Conversion of p35 to p25 deregulates cdk5 activity, resulting in an increased cdk5 kinase activity [191]. Calpain cleaves p35 into p25, and thus controls cdk5 activation [192]. Furthermore, tau is dephosphorylated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin [193]. Calpain was also proposed to directly participate in tau proteolysis and degradation"
