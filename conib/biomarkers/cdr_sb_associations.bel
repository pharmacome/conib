SET Evidence = "The present study was undertaken to validate the measurement of biomarkers as a supplement to the latest diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia by National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) work group using a sample attending a tertiary care center in Southern India. A total of 20 subjects diagnosed clinically as Alzheimer's dementia according to the NIA-AA criteria for AD were included in the study. The CSF biomarkers Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau181 were assessed. The biomarker results were compared among mild and moderate to severe AD as defined in the NIA-AA work group guidelines. The results revealed that the amount of Abeta42 was very low in all the 20 samples (<50pg/ml) collected from mild AD cases with CDR score of 1 (n=8), and moderate to severe AD cases with CDR >1 (n=12). t-tau and p-tau levels were in the range of 39.45+/-5.09pg/ml and 13.06+/-7.32pg/ml for CDR 1 group. t-tau and p-tau levels were in the range of 49.9+/-11.28pg/ml and 33.94+/-15.13pg/ml for moderate to severe cases. Analysis of the data revealed statistically significant differences in the p-tau/t-tau ratio and p-tau/Abeta ratio between CDR 1and CDR >1 AD cases (p<0.001) suggesting that p-tau/t-tau and p-tau/Abeta ratio are good indicators of severity of dementia with discriminative value in differentiating mild AD from moderate to severe AD."

SET Evidence = "Mitochondria are pivotal in controlling cell life and death not only by producing ATP, and sequestering calcium, but by also generating free radicals and serving as repositories for proteins which regulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Perturbations in the physiological function of mitochondria inevitably disturb cell function, sensitize cells to neurotoxic insults and may initiate cell death, all significant phenomena in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative disorders including AD."
