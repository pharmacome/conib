We aimed to study the relationship between YKL-40 and brain structure and its interactions with core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-beta 1-42 [Abeta42], total tau, p-tau, and YKL-40) of 80 cognitively normal controls and 27 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were classified as Abeta42+ (<550 pg/mL) or Abeta42- (>550 pg/mL). CTh difference maps were derived from the interaction and correlation analyses in the whole sample and within clinical groups. There was a strong correlation between YKL-40 and markers of neurodegeneration (total tau and p-tau). In the whole sample, we found a negative correlation between YKL-40 and CTh in AD vulnerable areas in Abeta42+ subjects but not in Abeta42 participants. Our results suggest that YKL-40 could track the inflammatory processes associated to tau-related neurodegeneration in the presence of the AD pathophysiological process.",

We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-beta 1-42 [Abeta42], total tau, p-tau, and YKL-40) of 80 cognitively normal controls and 27 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were classified as Abeta42+ (<550 pg/mL) or Abeta42- (>550 pg/mL). CTh difference maps were derived from the interaction and correlation analyses in the whole sample and within clinical groups. There was a strong correlation between YKL-40 and markers of neurodegeneration (total tau and p-tau). In the whole sample, we found a negative correlation between YKL-40 and CTh in AD vulnerable areas in Abeta42+ subjects but not in Abeta42 participants. Our results suggest that YKL-40 could track the inflammatory processes associated to tau-related neurodegeneration in the presence of the AD pathophysiological process.",

We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-beta 1-42 [Abeta42], total tau, p-tau, and YKL-40) of 80 cognitively normal controls and 27 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were classified as Abeta42+ (<550 pg/mL) or Abeta42- (>550 pg/mL). CTh difference maps were derived from the interaction and correlation analyses in the whole sample and within clinical groups. There was a strong correlation between YKL-40 and markers of neurodegeneration (total tau and p-tau). In the whole sample, we found a negative correlation between YKL-40 and CTh in AD vulnerable areas in Abeta42+ subjects but not in Abeta42 participants.

Alzheimer's disease causes massive axonal disruption and the dislocation of tau protein from its usual axonal domain into neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and presynaptic regions. The normal pattern of axonal staining in cortex is disrupted and white matter staining is reduced. Prominent abnormal tau-immunoreactive neuropil fibers are densely present even in cortical regions without classical neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque formation. The striking neuropil abnormalities, revealed by the aberrant localization of tau protein, are likely to contribute to neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.",

We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-beta 1-42 [Abeta42], total tau, p-tau, and YKL-40) of 80 cognitively normal controls and 27 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were classified as Abeta42+ (<550 pg/mL) or Abeta42- (>550 pg/mL). CTh difference maps were derived from the interaction and correlation analyses in the whole sample and within clinical groups. There was a strong correlation between YKL-40 and markers of neurodegeneration (total tau and p-tau). In the whole sample, we found a negative correlation between YKL-40 and CTh in AD vulnerable areas in Abeta42+ subjects but not in Abeta42 participants. Our results suggest that YKL-40 could track the inflammatory processes associated to tau-related neurodegeneration in the presence of the AD pathophysiological process.",

We aimed to study the relationship between YKL-40 and brain structure and its interactions with core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-beta 1-42 [Abeta42], total tau, p-tau, and YKL-40) of 80 cognitively normal controls and 27 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were classified as Abeta42+ (<550 pg/mL) or Abeta42- (>550 pg/mL). CTh difference maps were derived from the interaction and correlation analyses in the whole sample and within clinical groups. There was a strong correlation between YKL-40 and markers of neurodegeneration (total tau and p-tau). In the whole sample, we found a negative correlation between YKL-40 and CTh in AD vulnerable areas in Abeta42+ subjects but not in Abeta42 participants. Our results suggest that YKL-40 could track the inflammatory processes associated to tau-related neurodegeneration in the presence of the AD pathophysiological process.",

TREM2 is expressed on microglial cells, the resident macrophages in the CNS, and functions to stimulate phagocytosis on one hand and to suppress cytokine production and inflammation on the other hand. The purpose of this paper is to discuss these recent developments including the potential role that TREM2 normally plays and how loss of function may contribute to AD pathogenesis by enhancing oxidative stress and inflammation within the CNS.",

Taken together, these findings suggest that Abeta-weighted cortical thickness values can be used as an objective biomarker of structural changes caused by amyloid pathology in the brain.",

      "evidence": "Sortilin receptor 1 (SORL1) is involved in cellular trafficking of amyloid precursor protein and plays an essential role in amyloid-beta peptide generation in Alzheimer disease (AD). The major A allele in a SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3824968, is associated with an increased AD risk. However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan.",

Taken together, these findings suggest that Abeta-weighted cortical thickness values can be used as an objective biomarker of structural changes caused by amyloid pathology in the brain.",

Greater amyloid burden has been shown to be positively associated with regional GM atrophy26,27,28, particularly in the superior temporal, medial frontal, and cingulate gyri in both structural and functional MRI studies29,30. In addition to the hypothesis of amyloid pathology, Cuenco et al.31 proposed another viewpoint that SORL1 increases dementia risk through effects on cerebrovascular abnormalities; SORL1 rs3824968 and its haplotypes were found to be associated with brain volume and WM hyperintensities in their study. This biological and neuroimaging evidence may suggest that SORL1 rs3824968 is associated with brain morphology in terms of A allele-related volumetric reduction caused by high Abeta load, cardiovascular disease, or both. However, additional studies are necessary to explore the potential mechanisms of SORL1 rs3824968 on the cellular and molecular determinants of brain structural differences in both demented and nondemented individuals.",

The major A allele in a SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3824968, is associated with an increased AD risk. However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan.",

We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta.

We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta. Our findings suggest a sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in which Amyloid beta induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, resulting in perturbed ceramide and cholesterol metabolism which, in turn, triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that leads to clinical disease.",

The major A allele in a SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3824968, is associated with an increased AD risk. However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan.",

Importantly, we determined that the CALHM1 P86L polymorphism (rs2986017) is significantly associated with AD in independent case-control studies of 3404 participants (allele-specific OR = 1.44, p = 2 x 10(-10)).

      "evidence": "The aim of this study was for the first time to investigate the in vivo cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding in early Alzheimer disease (AD) patients in relation to cortical Abeta burden. Eleven newly diagnosed untreated AD patients (mean MMSE 24, range 19-27) and twelve age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent a two-hour dynamic [11C]SB207145 PET scan to measure the binding potential of the 5-HT4 receptor. All AD patients and eight healthy controls additionally underwent a [11C]PIB PET scan to measure the cortical Abeta burden. When AD patients were defined on clinical criteria, no difference in cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding between AD patients and healthy controls was found (p = 0.54). However, when individuals were reassigned to groups according to their amyloid status, the PIB-positive individuals had 13% higher 5-HT4 receptor levels than PIB-negative individuals (p = 0.02) and the importance of classification of groups is emphasized. The 5-HT4 receptor binding was a positively correlated to Abeta burden (p = 0.03) and negatively to MMSE score of the AD patients (p = 0.02). Our data suggests that cerebral 5-HT4 receptor upregulation starts at a preclinical stage of and continues while dementia is still at a mild stage, which contrasts other receptor subtypes. We speculate that this may either be a compensatory effect of decreased levels of interstitial 5-HT, an attempt to improve cognitive function, increase acetylcholine release or to counteract Abeta accumulation.",

We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta.

      "evidence": " Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related disorder characterized by deposition of Amyloid beta and degeneration of neurons in brain regions such as the hippocampus, resulting in progressive cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of AD is tightly linked to Amyloid beta deposition and oxidative stress, but it remains unclear as to how these factors result in neuronal dysfunction and death. We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta. Our findings suggest a sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in which Amyloid beta induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, resulting in perturbed ceramide and cholesterol metabolism which, in turn, triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that leads to clinical disease.",

      "evidence": "The aim of this study was for the first time to investigate the in vivo cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding in early Alzheimer disease (AD) patients in relation to cortical Abeta burden. Eleven newly diagnosed untreated AD patients (mean MMSE 24, range 19-27) and twelve age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent a two-hour dynamic [11C]SB207145 PET scan to measure the binding potential of the 5-HT4 receptor. All AD patients and eight healthy controls additionally underwent a [11C]PIB PET scan to measure the cortical Abeta burden. When AD patients were defined on clinical criteria, no difference in cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding between AD patients and healthy controls was found (p = 0.54). However, when individuals were reassigned to groups according to their amyloid status, the PIB-positive individuals had 13% higher 5-HT4 receptor levels than PIB-negative individuals (p = 0.02) and the importance of classification of groups is emphasized. The 5-HT4 receptor binding was a positively correlated to Abeta burden (p = 0.03) and negatively to MMSE score of the AD patients (p = 0.02). Our data suggests that cerebral 5-HT4 receptor upregulation starts at a preclinical stage of and continues while dementia is still at a mild stage, which contrasts other receptor subtypes. We speculate that this may either be a compensatory effect of decreased levels of interstitial 5-HT, an attempt to improve cognitive function, increase acetylcholine release or to counteract Abeta accumulation.",

However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan.",

The major A allele in a SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3824968, is associated with an increased AD risk. However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan.",

The pathogenesis of AD is tightly linked to Amyloid beta deposition and oxidative stress, but it remains unclear as to how these factors result in neuronal dysfunction and death. We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta. Our findings suggest a sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in which Amyloid beta induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, resulting in perturbed ceramide and cholesterol metabolism which, in turn, triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that leads to clinical disease.",

We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta. Our findings suggest a sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in which Amyloid beta induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, resulting in perturbed ceramide and cholesterol metabolism which, in turn, triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that leads to clinical disease.",

      "evidence": " Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related disorder characterized by deposition of Amyloid beta and degeneration of neurons in brain regions such as the hippocampus, resulting in progressive cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of AD is tightly linked to Amyloid beta deposition and oxidative stress, but it remains unclear as to how these factors result in neuronal dysfunction and death. We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta. Our findings suggest a sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in which Amyloid beta induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, resulting in perturbed ceramide and cholesterol metabolism which, in turn, triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that leads to clinical disease.",

We found no difference in CBâ‚�R availability between AD and HV, VOI-based fractional uptake values (FUR) were 0.043Â±0.01 for AD and 0.045Â±0.01 for controls (p=0.9). CBâ‚�R availability did not correlate with neuropsychological test scores and was not modulated by ApoE genotype. As expected, global [Â¹Â¹C]PIB SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio) was increased in AD (SUVR 1.9Â±0.3) compared to HV (1.2Â±0.1) with p<0.001, but no correlation was found between amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and CBâ‚�R availability.",
