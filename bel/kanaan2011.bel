SET Evidence ="perfusion of full-length WT tau monomers (2 􏰊M) (Fig. 1 A) had no effect on FAT in squid axoplasm (Fig. 2 A), while 6D and 6P tau monomers (2 􏰊M) significantly inhibited anterograde FAT when compared with WT tau monomer (Fig. 2 B, C) or buf- fer controls (data not shown)."

SET Evidence ="Together, these data demonstrate that, as posited for aggregated tau (LaPointe et al., 2009), short N-terminal isoforms of tau inhibit anterograde FAT by a mech- anism involving activation of PP1 and GSK3 that is independent of microtubule binding."

SET Evidence ="As observed with 􏰁2–18 tau aggregates (LaPointe et al., 2009), monomeric 􏰁2–18 6D tau showed no effect on FAT (Fig. 4 A, D), demonstrating that PAD is necessary for 6D tau- mediated inhibition of anterograde FAT."

SET Evidence ="P-c-Jun was dephosphorylated to a greater extent in PAD peptide-perfused axoplasms than their scrambled peptide- perfused counterpart (Fig. 5F ), suggesting that the PAD peptide induced activation of endogenous axoplasmic phosphatases."

SET Evidence ="A trend of elevated GSK3 activity (􏰈32%) relative to PKC activity ( p 􏰄 0.28, paired t test; n 􏰄 3) was observed for axoplasms incubated with the PAD peptide (mean 􏰄 4.9 􏰉 2.5), compared with those incubated with scram- bled peptide (mean 􏰄 3.7 􏰉 1.7), which supports the results from vesicle motility assays. "
p(HBP:"6D tau",frag("2_18")) -| act(p(MESH:"Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3"))

SET Evidence ="Soluble AT8 tau monomers inhibited anterograde FAT (Fig. 6 A, C), while retrograde trans- port was unaffected (Fig. 6 A, D). These data indicate that phos- phorylation of tau at the AT8 epitope, which is associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD and other tauopathies, renders soluble monomeric tau capable of inhibiting antero- grade FAT."

SET Evidence =" Consistent with our model, 􏰁144 –273 tau monomers significantly inhibited antero- grade FAT (Fig. 6 B, C), while retrograde FAT remained unaf- fected (Fig. 6 B, D).Together, these data indicate that disease- associated modifications and mutations in tau that increase exposure of PAD promote activation of the PP1–GSK3 pathway and inhibition of anterograde FAT."

p(HBP:TNT1) -- p(HBP:"6D tau",frag("2_18"))
complex(p(HBP:PAD),p(HBP:"6D tau",frag("2_18")))

SET Evidence ="These data indicated that increased PAD exposure, as revealed by TNT1 immunoreac- tivity, occurs early in AD and remains present throughout the disease process."
act(p(HBP:"6D tau",frag("2_18"))) -- path(MESH:"Alzheimer Disease")

SET Evidence =" Together, these data suggest that increased PAD exposure represents an early event in AD pathogenesis and that AT8 may not be required for PAD ex- posure in situ."
