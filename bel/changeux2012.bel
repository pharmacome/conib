SET Evidence ="As anticipated, TDF interacted covalently with E. electricus electroplaque as an irreversible competitive antagonist, and curare protected against this cova- lent attachment"
# TDF = p-trim- ethylammonium benzenediazonium fluoroborate (TDF). Skipping the fluoroborate part for now.
a(CHEBI:"4-(trimethylammonium)benzenediazonium") -| act(a(MESH:"Electric Organ"))
a(MESH:Curare) -| act(a(CHEBI:"4-(trimethylammonium)benzenediazonium"))

SET Evidence ="The method was subsequently improved upon with the synthesis of 4-(N-maleimido)phenyltrimethyl- ammonium iodide, whereby the diazonium is substituted with a maleimide group"
# the method = affinity labeling
a(CHEBI:"4-(N-Maleimido)phenyltrimethylammonium iodide") -> act(a(MESH:"Affinity Labels"))

SET Evidence ="It was now possible to follow reversible binding to these purified membranes using the nicotinic agonist decamethonium as the radioactive ligand (by the method of equilibrium dialysis that Gilbert and Müller-Hill (9) used to identify the lac repressor)"
a(CHEBI:decamethonium) -| act(a(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))


SET Evidence ="The detergent deoxycholate gently extracted the binding protein without denaturing it, and bound decamethonium was displaced by var- ious nicotinic agonists and antagonists, including curare and Flaxedil in the order of their physiological effects"
a(MESH:"Gallamine Triethiodide") -| act(a(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))

SET Evidence ="Third, Chen-Yuan Lee, a Taiwanese pharmacologist, had found that a snake venom toxin, 􏰂-bungarotoxin (􏰂-BGT), spe- cifically blocks in vivo neuromuscular transmission in high ver- tebrates at the postsynaptic level without interacting with AChE"

a(MESH:Bungarotoxins) -| bp(GO:"neuromuscular synaptic transmission")

SET Evidence ="alpha􏰂-BGT blocked the electroplaque’s electrical response in vivo and the microsac’s ion flux response to nicotinic agonists in vitro; alpha􏰂-BGT also blocked the binding of radioactive decamethonium to the detergent extract"
a(MESH:Bungarotoxins)  -| act(a(MESH:"Electric Organ"))
a(MESH:Bungarotoxins) -| act(a(CHEBI:decamethonium))

SET Evidence ="Confirmation of the binding site organization has come from the crystal structure of a soluble snail protein that binds ACh, the ACh-binding protein, a close homolog of the nAChR extra- cellular domain (60) and of the full-length eukaryotic GluCl receptor (61) and the prokaryotic Erwinia chrysanthemi recep- tor (ELIC) bound with GABA (62) and ACh (as an antagonist)"

SET Evidence =" UV irradiation of the 3H-labeled 􏰀-toxin-Torpedo receptor complex resulted in the incorporation of covalently bound radioactivity not only into the alpha􏰀-subunit but also into the gamma􏰃- and delta􏰄-subunits"

SET Evidence ="One of these compounds, chlorpromazine, displayed, in addi- tion, the remarkable property of covalently linking to the recep- tor protein by simple UV irradiation"

complex(a(CHEBI:chlorpromazine),p(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))

SET Evidence ="In receptor-rich mem- branes from T. marmorata, chlorpromazine labeled the four types of subunits of the nAChR (67), and precise quantitative measurements demonstrated that it bound to just one high affinity site per 2alpha􏰀1beta􏰂1gamma􏰃1delta􏰄1 oligomer (68)."

a(CHEBI:chlorpromazine) -- complex(p(HGNC:CHRNA1),p(HGNC:CHRNA1),p(HGNC:CHRNB1),p(HGNC:CHRNG),p(HGNC:CHRND))

SET Evidence ="The kinetics of access of chlorpromazine to this site increased by 100-fold when rap- idly mixed with ACh under conditions expected to generate functional ion channels"

p(HGNC:ACHE) -> act(a(CHEBI:chlorpromazine))

SET Evidence ="It took more than a year to demonstrate that chlorpromazine labels serine 262, within the second transmembrane segment (TM2) of the delta􏰄-subunit"
a(CHEBI:chlorpromazine) -- p(HGNC:SCNN1D)

SET Evidence ="One group of modulators includes Ca2+􏰆, which potentiates most neuronal nAChRs (99, 100) and binds to the extracellular domain below the ACh site at residues contributed from both sides of the subunit interface (96). Another includes Zn2 􏰆 ."

a(CHEBI:"calcium(2+)") -> act(p(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))
a(CHEBI:"zinc(2+)") -> act(p(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))

SET Evidence ="A second important group consists of modulators, such as galantamine, that bind at “non-agonist” interfaces, which, in heteropentameric nAChRs, differ from the neurotransmitter- binding site and appear to be homologs of the benzodiazepine site on GABAA receptors"

a(MESH:Galantamine) reg act(p(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic"))

SET Evidence ="The antihelminthic ivermectin was originally discovered to behave as a strong positive modulator of alpha􏰀7-nAChR "

a(MESH:Ivermectin) -> act(p(HGNC:CHRNA7))

SET Evidence ="Its action was altered by mutations within the TM2 domain"

p(HGNC:SCNN1D,var(?)) reg act(a(MESH:Ivermectin))

SET Evidence ="General anesthetics (both intravenous and volatile) negatively modulate excitatory nAChRs but posi- tively enhance inhibitory GABA receptors."

a(MESH:Anesthetics) -| p(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic")
a(MESH:Anesthetics) -> p(MESH:"Receptors, GABA")

SET Evidence ="In nAChRs, several phosphorylation sites (104) that control desensitization in mus- cle and 􏰀7-nAChR also contribute to end plate localization by agrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein 43K-rapsyn "

p(HGNC:CHRNA7,pmod(Ph)) -> act(a(MESH:"Motor Endplate"),ma(GO:localization))

p(HGNC:RAPSN,pmod(Ph,Tyr)) -> act(a(MESH:"Motor Endplate"),ma(GO:localization))
p(MESH:"Receptors, Nicotinic",pmod(Ph)) -> act(p(MESH:Agrin))

SET Evidence ="The cytoplasmic domain of the alpha􏰀4-nAChR subunit also binds a variety of scaffold proteins that interact with cytoskeletal proteins and with G protein systems that are involved in intracellular signaling pathways"
